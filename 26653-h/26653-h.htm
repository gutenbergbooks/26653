<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Up the Baltic</span>,
the first volume of the second series of
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Young America Abroad</span>,&rdquo;
like its predecessors, is a record
of what was seen and done by the young gentlemen of the
Academy Squadron on its second voyage to Europe, embracing
its stay in the waters of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.
Agreeably to the announcement made in the concluding volume
of the first series, the author spent the greater portion
of last year in Europe. His sole object in going abroad was
to obtain the material for the present series of books, and in
carrying out his purpose, he visited every country to which
these volumes relate, and, he hopes, properly fitted himself
for the work he has undertaken.</p>

<p>In the preparation of <span class="smcap">Up the Baltic</span>,
the writer has used,
besides his own note-books, the most reliable works he could
obtain at home and in Europe, and he believes his geographical,
historical, and political matter is correct, and as
full as could be embodied in a story. He has endeavored to
describe the appearance of the country, and the manners and
customs of the people, so as to make them interesting to
young readers. For this purpose these descriptions are often
interwoven with the story, or brought out in the comments
of the boys of the squadron.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
The story is principally the adventures of the crew of the
second cutter, who attempted &ldquo;an independent excursion
without running away,&rdquo; which includes the career of a young
Englishman, spoiled by his mother&#8217;s indulgence, and of a
Norwegian waif, picked up by the squadron in the North
Sea.</p>

<p>The author is encouraged to enter upon this second series
by the remarkable and unexpected success which attended
the publication of the first series. Difficult as it is to work
the dry details of geography and history into a story, the
writer intends to persevere in his efforts to make these books
instructive, as well as interesting; and he is confident that no
reader will fail to distinguish the good boys from the bad ones
of the story, or to give his sympathies to the former.</p>

<h1>UP THE BALTIC;</h1>
<p class="center">OR,</p>
<h2>YOUNG AMERICA IN NORWAY, SWEDEN,<br />
AND DENMARK.</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>A WAIF ON THE NORTH SEA.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;Boat on the weather bow, sir!&rdquo; shouted the
lookout on the top-gallant forecastle of the
Young America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starboard!&rdquo; replied Judson, the officer of the
deck, as he discovered the boat, which was drifting
into the track of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starboard, sir!&rdquo; responded the quartermaster
in charge of the wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; added the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, sir,&rdquo; repeated the quartermaster.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd of young officers and seamen
had leaped upon the top-gallant forecastle, and into
the weather rigging, to obtain a view of the little boat,
which, like a waif on the ocean, was drifting down
towards the coast of Norway. It contained only a
single person, who was either a dwarf or a boy, for
he was small in stature. He lay upon a seat near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the stern of the boat, with his feet on the gunwale.
He was either asleep or dead, for though the ship
had approached within hail, he neither moved nor
made any sign. The wind was light from the southward,
and the sea was quite calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, Ryder?&rdquo; called the
officer of the deck to the second master, who was on
duty forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a flat-bottomed boat, half full of water, with
a boy in it,&rdquo; answered Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hail him,&rdquo; added the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat, ahoy!&rdquo; shouted Ryder, at the top of his
lungs.</p>

<p>The person in the boat, boy or man, made no
reply. Ryder repeated the hail, but with no better
success. The officers and seamen held their breath
with interest and excitement, for most of them had
already come to the conclusion that the occupant of
the boat was dead. A feeling akin to horror crept
through the minds of the more timid, as they gazed
upon the immovable body in the dilapidated craft; for
they felt that they were in the presence of death, and
to young people this is always an impressive season.
By this time the ship was within a short distance of
the water-logged bateau. As the waif on the ocean
exhibited no signs of life, the first lieutenant, in charge
of the vessel, was in doubt as to what he should do.</p>

<p>Though he knew that it was the first duty of a
sailor to assist a human being in distress, he was not
sure that the same effort was required in behalf of one
who had already ceased to live. Captain Cumberland,
in command of the ship, who had been in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
cabin when the excitement commenced, now appeared
upon the quarter-deck, and relieved the officer of the
responsibility of the moment. Judson reported the
cause of the unwonted scene on deck, and as the captain
discovered the little boat, just on the weather bow,
he promptly directed the ship to be hove to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the main clew-garnets and buntlines!&rdquo;
shouted the first lieutenant; and the hands sprang to
their several stations. &ldquo;Stand by tack and sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, sir,&rdquo; reported the first midshipman,
who was on duty in the waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go tack and sheet! Up mainsail!&rdquo; continued
Ryder.</p>

<p>The well-trained crew promptly obeyed the several
orders, and the mainsail was hauled up in much less
time than it takes to describe the man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the main braces!&rdquo; proceeded the officer of
the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready, sir,&rdquo; reported the first midshipman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go and haul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the hands executed the last order; all the yards
on the mainmast swung round towards the wind till
the light breeze caught the sails aback, and brought
them against the mast. The effect was to deaden the
headway of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast bracing!&rdquo; shouted the first lieutenant, when
the yards on the mainmast were about square.</p>

<p>In a few moments the onward progress of the
Young America was entirely checked, and she lay
motionless on the sea. There were four other vessels
in the squadron, following the flag-ship, and each of
them, in its turn, hove to, or came up into the wind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fourth cutters, clear away their boat!&rdquo; continued
the first lieutenant, after he had received his order
from the captain. &ldquo;Mr. Messenger will take charge
of the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young officer indicated was the first midshipman,
whose quarter watch was then on duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the fourth cutters!&rdquo; piped the boatswain&#8217;s
mate, as Messenger crossed the deck to perform the
duty assigned to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s alive!&rdquo; shouted a dozen of the idlers on the
rail, who had not removed their gaze from the waif in
the small boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&#8217;t dead any more than I am!&rdquo; added a
juvenile tar, springing into the main rigging, as if to
demonstrate the amount of his own vitality.</p>

<p>The waif in the bateau had produced this sudden
change of sentiment, and given this welcome relief
to the crew of the Young America, by rising from
his reclining posture, and standing up in the water at
the bottom of his frail craft. He gazed with astonishment
at the ship and the other vessels of the squadron,
and did not seem to realize where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast, fourth cutters!&rdquo; interposed the first lieutenant.
&ldquo;Belay, all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the waif was not dead, it was hardly necessary to
lower a boat to send to his relief; at least not till it
appeared that he needed assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat, ahoy!&rdquo; shouted Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On board the ship,&rdquo; replied the waif, in tones not
at all sepulchral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing out here?&rdquo; demanded the
first lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come on board the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will let me,&rdquo; added the stranger, as he
picked up a broken oar, which was floating in the
water on the bottom of his boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, come on board,&rdquo; answered the first lieutenant,
prompted by Captain Cumberland, who was
quite as much interested in the adventure as any of his
shipmates.</p>

<p>The waif, using the broken oar as a paddle, worked
his water-logged craft slowly towards the ship. The
accommodation ladder was lowered for his use, and
in a few moments, with rather a heavy movement, as
though he was lame, or much exhausted, he climbed
up the ladder, and stepped down upon the ship deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fill away again!&rdquo; said the captain to the first lieutenant,
as a curious crowd began to gather around the
stranger. Ryder gave the necessary orders to brace
up the main yards, and set the mainsail again, and the
ship was soon moving on her course towards the Naze
of Norway, as though nothing had occurred to interrupt
her voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing out here, in an open boat,
out of sight of land?&rdquo; asked Captain Cumberland,
while the watch on deck were bracing up the yards.</p>

<p>The waif looked at the commander of the Young
America, and carefully examined him from head to
foot. The elegant uniform of the captain seemed to
produce a strong impression upon his mind, and he
evidently regarded him as a person of no small consequence.
He did not answer the question put to
him, seeming to be in doubt whether it was safe and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
proper for him to do so. Captain Cumberland was
an exceedingly comely-looking young gentleman, tall
and well formed in person, graceful and dignified in
his manners; and if he had been fifty years old, the
stranger before him could not have been more awed
and impressed by his bearing. So far as his personal
appearance was concerned, the waif appeared to have
escaped from the rag-bag, and to have been out long
enough to soil his tatters with oil, tar, pitch, and dirt.
Though his face and hands, as well as other parts of
his body, were very dirty, his eye was bright, and,
even seen through the disguise of filth and rags that
covered him, he was rather prepossessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Captain Cumberland,
finding his first question was not likely to be
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole Amundsen,&rdquo; replied the stranger, pronouncing
his first name in two syllables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are not English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Be you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not; we are all Americans in this ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Americans!&rdquo; exclaimed Ole, opening his eyes,
while a smile beamed through the dirt on his face.
&ldquo;Are you going to America now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we are going up the Baltic now,&rdquo; replied
Captain Cumberland; &ldquo;but we shall return to America
in the course of a year or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me to America with you&mdash;will you?&rdquo; continued
Ole, earnestly. &ldquo;I am a sailor, and I will
work for you all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know about that. You must speak to the
principal.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lowington. He is in the cabin now.
Where do you belong, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t belong anywhere,&rdquo; answered the waif,
looking doubtfully about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Norway, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are a Norwegian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what part of Norway were you born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Bratsberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s where all the brats come from,&rdquo; suggested
Sheridan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one came from there, at any rate,&rdquo; added
Mayley. &ldquo;But where is Bratsberg, and what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an <em>amt</em>, or province, in the south-eastern part
of Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came from the town of Laurdal,&rdquo; said Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the people there speak English as well as you
do?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I used to be a <em>skydskarl</em>, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; demanded the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>skydskarl</em>&mdash;a boy that goes on a cariole to
take back the horses. I learned a little English from
the Englishmen I rode with; and then I was in England
almost a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how came you out here, alone in an open
boat?&rdquo; asked the captain, returning to his first
inquiry.</p>

<p>Ole put one of his dirty fingers in his mouth, and
looked stupid and uncommunicative. He glanced at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the young officers around him, and then over the rail
at the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you wrecked?&rdquo; inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not wrecked,&rdquo; replied Ole. &ldquo;I never
was wrecked in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing out here, out of sight of land,
in a boat half full of water?&rdquo; persisted the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get blown off from the shore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; a southerly wind wouldn&#8217;t blow anybody
off from the south coast of Norway,&rdquo; answered
Ole, with a smile which showed that he had some
perception of things absurd in themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I am not; and I don&#8217;t think you are,&rdquo;
added Ole, again glancing at Captain Cumberland
from head to foot.</p>

<p>The young tars all laughed at the waif&#8217;s retort, and
the captain was not a little nettled by the remark.
He pressed Ole rather sharply for further information
in regard to his antecedents; but the youth was silent
on this point. While the crowd were anxiously waiting
for the stranger to declare himself more definitely,
eight bells sounded at the wheel, and were repeated
on the large bell forward by the lookout. From each
vessel of the fleet the bells struck at nearly the same
moment, and were followed by the pipe of the boatswain&#8217;s
whistle, which was the signal for changing
the watch. As the officers of the ship were obliged
to attend to their various duties, Ole Amundsen was
left alone with the captain. The waif still obstinately
refused to explain how he happened to be alone in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
water-logged boat, asleep, and out of sight of land,
though he promptly answered all other questions
which were put to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington, the principal of the Academy
Squadron, was in the main cabin, though he had
been fully informed in regard to the events which
had transpired on deck. The young commander despaired
of his own ability to extort an explanation
from the waif, and he concluded to refer the matter
to the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in that boat?&rdquo; asked
Captain Cumberland, as he led the way towards the
companion ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen hours,&rdquo; answered Ole, after some hesitation,
which, perhaps, was only to enable him to count
up the hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a little supper last night&mdash;not much,&rdquo; continued
Ole, apparently counting the seams in the deck,
ashamed to acknowledge his human weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have something to eat at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cumberland therefore conducted the stranger
to the steerage, instead of the main cabin, and
directed one of the stewards to give him his supper.
The man set half a cold boiled ham on one of the
mess tables, with an abundant supply of bread and
butter. Cutting off a large slice of the ham, he placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
it on the plate before Ole, whose eyes opened wide
with astonishment, and gleamed with pleasure. Without
paying much attention to the forms of civilization,
the boy began to devour it, with the zeal of one who
had not tasted food for twenty-four hours. Captain
Cumberland smiled, but with becoming dignity, at the
greediness of the guest, before whom the whole slice
of ham and half a brick loaf disappeared almost in a
twinkling. The steward appeared with a pot of coffee,
in time to cut off another slice of ham, which the
waif attacked with the same voracity as before. When
it was consumed, and the young Norwegian glanced
wistfully at the leg before him, as though his capacity
for cold ham was not yet exhausted, the captain began
to consider whether he ought not to consult the
surgeon of the ship before he permitted the waif to
eat any more. But the steward, like a generous host,
seemed to regard the quantity eaten as complimentary
testimony to the quality of the viands, and helped
him to a third slice of the ham. He swallowed a
pint mug of coffee without stopping to breathe.</p>

<p>As the third slice of ham began to wax small before
the voracious Norwegian, Captain Cumberland became
really alarmed, and determined to report at
once to the principal and the surgeon for instructions.
Knocking at the door of the main cabin, he was admitted.
Dr. Winstock assured him there was no danger
to the guest; he had not been without food long enough
to render it dangerous for him fully to satisfy himself.
The quantity eaten might make him uncomfortable,
and even slightly sick, but it would do the gourmand
no real injury. The captain returned to the steerage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
where Ole had broken down on his fourth slice of
ham; but he regarded it wistfully, and seemed to regret
his inability to eat any more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s good,&rdquo; said he, with emphasis. &ldquo;It&#8217;s the
best supper I ever ate in my life. I like this ship; I
like the grub; and I mean to go to America in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see about that some other time; but if
you don&#8217;t tell us how you happened to be off here, I
am afraid we can do nothing for you,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;If you feel better now, we will go and see the
principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s he?&rdquo; asked Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lowington. You must tell him how you happened
to be in that leaky boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will. I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; added Ole, doubtfully,
as he followed the commander into the main
cabin.</p>

<p>Captain Cumberland explained to the principal the
circumstances under which Ole had come on board,
and that he declined to say anything in regard to the
strange situation in which he had been discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the captain here?&rdquo; asked the midshipman of
the watch, at the steerage door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Captain Cumberland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lincoln sent me down to report a light on
the lee bow, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Where is Mr. Beckwith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cabin, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain left the main cabin, and entered the after
cabin, where he found Beckwith, the first master,
attended by the second and third, examining the large
chart of the North Sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
&ldquo;Light on the lee bow, sir,&rdquo; said the first master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you make it out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we are all right to the breadth of a hair,&rdquo;
added the master, delighted to find that his calculations
had proved to be entirely correct. &ldquo;It is Egero Light,
and we are about fifty miles from the Naze of Norway.
We are making about four knots, and if the
breeze holds, we ought to see Gunnarshoug Light by
one o&#8217;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cumberland went on deck to see the light
reported. Though it was half past eight, the sun had
but just set, and the light, eighteen miles distant, could
be distinctly seen. It created a great deal of excitement
and enthusiasm among the young officers and
seamen, who had read enough about Norway to be
desirous of seeing it. For weeks the young gentlemen
on board the ship had been talking of Norway, and
reading up all the books in the library relating to the
country and its people. They had read with interest
the accounts of the various travellers who had visited
it, including Ross Brown, in Harper&#8217;s Monthly, and
Bayard Taylor, and had studied Harper, Murray,
Bradshaw, and other Guides on the subject. The
more inquiring students had read the history of Norway,
and were well prepared to appreciate a short
visit to this interesting region.</p>

<p>They had just come from the United States, having
sailed in the latter part of March. The squadron had
had a fair passage, and the students hoped to be in
Christiansand by the first day of May; and now nothing
less than a dead calm for forty-eight hours could
disappoint their hopes. Five years before, the Young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
America and the Josephine, her consort, had cruised
in the waters of Europe, and returned to America
in the autumn. It had been the intention of the principal
to make another voyage the next year, go up the
Baltic, and winter in the Mediterranean; but the war
of 1866 induced him to change his plans. Various
circumstances had postponed the cruise until 1870,
when it was actually commenced.</p>

<p>The Young America was the first, and for more
than a year the only, vessel belonging to the Academy.
The Josephine, a topsail schooner, had been
added the second year; and now the Tritonia, a vessel
of the same size and rig, was on her first voyage.
The three vessels of the squadron were officered and
manned by the students of the Academy. As on the
first cruise, the offices were the rewards of merit bestowed
upon the faithful and energetic pupils. The
highest number of merits gave the highest office, and
so on through the several grades in the cabin, and the
petty offices in the steerage. The routine and discipline
of the squadron were substantially the same as
described in the first series of these volumes, though
some changes had been made, as further experience
suggested. Instead of quarterly, as before, the offices
were given out every month. Captains were not retired
after a single term, as formerly, but were obliged
to accept whatever rank and position they earned, like
other students.</p>

<p>There was no change from one vessel to another,
except at the end of a school year, or with the permission
of the principal. The ship had six instructors,
three of whom, however, lectured to all the students
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the squadron, and each of the smaller vessels had
two teachers. Mr. Lowington was still the principal.
He was the founder of the institution; and his high
moral and religious principles, his love of justice, as
well as his skill, firmness, and prudence, had made it
a success in spite of the many obstacles which continually
confronted it. As a considerable portion of the
students in the squadron were the spoiled sons of rich
men, who had set at defiance the rules of colleges and
academies on shore, it required a remarkable combination
of attributes to fit a gentleman for the difficult and
trying position he occupied.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion was the first vice-principal in charge
of the Josephine. He was a thorough seaman, a good
disciplinarian, and a capital teacher; but he lacked
some of the high attributes of character which distinguished
the principal. If any man was fit to succeed
Mr. Lowington in his responsible position, it was Mr.
Fluxion; but it was doubtful whether, under his sole
administration, the institution could be an entire success.
His love of discipline, and his energetic manner
of dealing with delinquents, would probably have
increased the number of &ldquo;rows,&rdquo; mutinies, and runaways.</p>

<p>The second vice-principal, in charge of the Tritonia,
was Mr. Tompion, who, like his two superiors
in rank, had formerly been an officer of the navy.
Though he was a good sailor, and a good disciplinarian,
he lacked that which a teacher needs most&mdash;a
hearty sympathy with young people.</p>

<p>The principal and the two vice-principals were instructors
in mathematics and navigation in their respective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
vessels. Mr. Lowington had undertaken this
task himself, because he felt the necessity of coming
more in contact with the student than his position as
mere principal required. It tended to promote friendly
relations between the governor and the governed,
by creating a greater sympathy between them.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Agneau still served as chaplain. In
port, and at sea when the weather would permit, two
services were held in the steerage every Sunday, which
were attended, at anchor, by the crew of all the vessels.
Prayers were said morning and evening, in the
ship by the chaplain, in the schooners by the vice-principal
or one of the instructors.</p>

<p>Dr. Winstock was the instructor in natural philosophy
and chemistry, as well as surgeon and sanitary
director. He was a good and true man, and generally
popular among the students. Each vessel had an
adult boatswain and a carpenter, and the ship a sailmaker,
to perform such work as the students could not
do, and to instruct them in the details of practical seamanship.</p>

<p>After the lapse of five years, hardly a student remained
of those who had cruised in the ship or her
consort during the first voyage. But in addition to
the three vessels which properly constituted the squadron,
there were two yachts, each of one hundred and
twenty tons. They were fore-and-aft schooners, of
beautiful model, and entirely new. The one on the
weather wing of the fleet was the Grace, Captain Paul
Kendall, whose lady and two friends were in the
cabin. Abreast of her sailed the Feodora, Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Robert Shuffles, whose wife was also with him. Each
of these yachts had a first and second officer, and a
crew of twenty men, with the necessary complement
of cooks and stewards. They were part of the fleet,
but not of the Academy Squadron.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>OFF THE NAZE OF NORWAY.</strong></p>


<p>Mr. Lowington examined Ole Amundsen
very carefully, in order to ascertain what disposition
should be made of him. He told where he
was born, how he had learned English, and where
he had passed the greater portion of his life, just as
he had related these particulars to Captain Cumberland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how came you out here in an open boat?&rdquo;
asked the principal.</p>

<p>Ole examined the carpet on the floor of the cabin,
and made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you answer me?&rdquo; added Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>The waif was still silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been to sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I was six months in a steamer, and over
two years in sailing vessels,&rdquo; answered Ole, readily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What steamer were you in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in the Drammen steamer a while; and I
have been three trips down to Copenhagen and Gottenburg,
one to L&uuml;beck, one to Stettin, and one to
Stockholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in a steamer this season?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then you were in a sailing vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole would not say that he had been in any vessel
the present season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your home now?&rdquo; asked the principal,
breaking the silence again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&#8217;t any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a father and mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both dead, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends? I don&#8217;t believe I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one that takes care of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takes care of me? No, sir; I&#8217;m quite certain I
haven&#8217;t any one that takes care of me. I take care of
myself, and it&#8217;s heavy work I find it, sometimes, I can
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever go fishing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole was silent again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to be your friend, Ole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; added Ole, bowing low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in order to know what to do for you, I must
know something about your circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t any circumstances, sir. I lost &#8217;em all,&rdquo;
replied Ole, gravely and sadly, as though he had met
with a very serious loss.</p>

<p>Dr. Winstock could not help laughing, but it was
impossible to decide whether the boy was ignorant of
the meaning of the word, or was trying to perpetrate
a joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to lose your circumstances,
Ole?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
&ldquo;When my mother died, Captain Olaf took &#8217;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed; and who is Captain Olaf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole looked at the principal, and then returned his
gaze to the cabin floor, evidently not deeming it prudent
to answer the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he your brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole could not be induced to say anything more
about Captain Olaf, and doubtless regretted that he
had even mentioned his name. The waif plainly confounded
&ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; and property. Mr. Lowington
several times returned to the main inquiry, but
the young man would not even hint at the explanation
of the manner in which he had come to be a waif on
the North Sea, in an open boat, half full of water.
He had told the captain that he was not wrecked, and
had not been blown off from the coast. He would
make no answer of any kind to any direct question
relating to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ole, as you will not tell me how you came
in the situation in which we found you, I do not see
that I can do anything for you,&rdquo; continued Mr. Lowington.
&ldquo;The ship is bound to Christiansand, and
when we arrive we must leave you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t leave me in Christiansand, sir. I don&#8217;t
want to be left there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole was silent again. Both the principal and the
surgeon pitied him, for he appeared to be a friendless
orphan; certainly he had no friends to whom he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
wished to go, and was only anxious to remain in the
ship, and go to America in her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go into the steerage now, Ole,&rdquo; said the
principal, despairing of any further solution of the
mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Ole, bowing low, and
backing out of the cabin as a courtier retires from
the presence of a sovereign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of him, doctor?&rdquo; added Mr.
Lowington, as the door closed upon the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t make anything of him,&rdquo; replied Dr. Winstock.
&ldquo;The young rascal evidently don&#8217;t intend that
we should make anything of him. He&#8217;s a young
Norwegian, about fifteen years old, with neither father
nor mother; for I think we may believe what he has
said. If he had no regard to the truth, it was just as
easy for him to lie as it was to keep silent, and it would
have been more plausible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to believe that he is a runaway,
either from the shore or from some vessel,&rdquo; said the
principal. &ldquo;He certainly cannot have been well
treated, for his filthy rags scarcely cover his body;
and he says that the supper he had to-night was the
best he ever ate in his life. It was only coffee, cold
ham, and bread and butter; so he cannot have been a
high liver. He seems to be honest, and I pity him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is too filthy to remain on board a single
hour. I will attend to his sanitary condition at once,&rdquo;
laughed the doctor. &ldquo;He will breed a leprosy among
the boys, if he is not taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the purser give you a suit of clothes for him,
for we can&#8217;t do less than this for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
The doctor left the cabin, and Ole was taken to the
bath-room by one of the stewards, and compelled to
scrub himself with a brush and soap, till he was made
into a new creature. He was inclined to rebel at first,
for he had his national and inborn prejudice against
soap and water in combination; but the sight of the
suit of new clothes overcame his constitutional scruples.
The steward was faithful to his mission, and
Ole left dirt enough in the bath-tub to plant half a
dozen hills of potatoes. He looked like a new being,
even before he had donned the new clothes. His light
hair, cut square across his forehead, was three shades
lighter when it had been scrubbed, and deprived of
the black earth, grease, and tar, with which it had
been matted.</p>

<p>The steward was interested in his work, for it is a
pleasure to any decent person to transform such a
leper of filth into a clean and wholesome individual.
Ole put on the heavy flannel shirt and the blue frock
which were handed to him, and smiled with pleasure
as he observed the effect. He was fitted to a pair of
seaman&#8217;s blue trousers, and provided with socks and
shoes. Then he actually danced with delight, and evidently
regarded himself as a finished dandy; for never
before had he been clothed in a suit half so good. It
was the regular uniform of the crew of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on a moment, my lad,&rdquo; said Muggs, the
steward, as he produced a pair of barber&#8217;s shears.
&ldquo;Your barber did not do justice to your figure-head,
the last time he cut your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cut it myself,&rdquo; replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you did, and with a bush scythe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
&ldquo;I only hacked off a little, to keep it out of my
eyes. Captain Olaf always used to cut it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s Captain Olaf?&rdquo; asked Muggs.</p>

<p>Ole was silent, but permitted the steward to remove
at will the long, snarly white locks, which covered his
head. The operator had been a barber once, and received
extra pay for his services on board the ship in
this capacity. He did his work in an artistic manner,
parting and combing the waif&#8217;s hair as though he were
dressing him for a fashionable party. He put a sailor&#8217;s
knot in the black handkerchief under the boy&#8217;s collar,
and then placed the blue cap on his head, a little on
one side, so that he looked as jaunty as a dandy man-of-war&#8217;s-man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now put on this jacket, my lad, and you will be
all right,&rdquo; continued the steward, as he gazed with
pride and pleasure upon the work of his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More clothes!&rdquo; exclaimed Ole. &ldquo;I shall be baked.
I sweat now with what I have on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s hot in here; you will be cool enough when
you go on deck. Here&#8217;s a pea-jacket for you, besides
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&#8217;s for winter. I never had so much clothes
on before in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&#8217;t put the pea-jacket on, if you don&#8217;t
want it. Now you look like a decent man, and you
can go on deck and show yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must wash yourself clean every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it every day!&rdquo; exclaimed Ole, opening his
eyes with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, you heathen,&rdquo; laughed Muggs. &ldquo;A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
man isn&#8217;t fit to live who don&#8217;t keep himself clean.
Why, you could have planted potatoes anywhere on
your hide, before you went into that tub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t been washed before since last summer,&rdquo;
added Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be hung for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spend half your time washing yourselves&mdash;don&#8217;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spend time enough at it to keep clean. No
wonder you Norwegians have the leprosy, and the
flesh rots off the bones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I always go into the water every summer,&rdquo;
pleaded Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&#8217;t wash yourself at any other time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always wash myself once a year, and sometimes
more, when I get a good chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you wash your face and hands every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every morning? No! I haven&#8217;t done such a
thing since last summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are not fit to live. If you stay in this
ship, you must wash every day, and more than that
when you do dirty work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I stay in the ship if I do that?&rdquo; asked Ole,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wash all the time if they will only let me
stay in the ship,&rdquo; pleaded the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must talk with the principal on that subject.
I have nothing to do with it. Now, go on deck. Hold
up your head, and walk like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole left the bath-room, and made his way up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
forward ladder. The second part of the starboard
watch were on duty, but nearly every person belonging
to the ship was on deck, watching the distant light,
which assured them they were on the coast of Norway.
The waif stepped upon deck as lightly as a
mountain sylph. The influence of his new clothes
pervaded his mind, and he was inclined to be a little
&ldquo;swellish&rdquo; in his manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Norway!&rdquo; shouted Sanford, one of
the crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, America,&rdquo; replied Ole, imitating
the slang of the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done with your dirt?&rdquo; added Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is some of it,&rdquo; answered Muggs, the steward,
as he came up the ladder, with Ole&#8217;s rags on a
dust-pan, and threw them overboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you throw all his dirt overboard here, we shall
get aground, sure,&rdquo; added Stockwell, as Ole danced
up to the group of students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder you feel light after getting rid of such
a load of dirt,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I&#8217;m all right,&rdquo; laughed Ole, good-naturedly; for
he did not seem to think that dirt was any disgrace or
dishonor to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you in that leaky boat, Norway?&rdquo; demanded
Rodman; and the entire party gathered around
the waif, anxious to hear the story of his adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; added Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Norway, you are smart,&rdquo; replied Rodman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
&ldquo;Smart? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Norway, how came you in that old tub, out
of sight of land?&rdquo; persisted Rodman, returning to the
charge again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went into it just the same as one of you Americans
would have got into it,&rdquo; laughed Ole, who did
not think it necessary to resort to the tactics he had
used with the principal and the captain. &ldquo;You could
have done it if you had tried as hard as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you got in, then, how came the boat out
here, so far from land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wind, the tide, and the broken oar brought it
out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! But won&#8217;t you tell us your story, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A story? O, yes. Once there was a king of Norway
whose name was Olaf, and half the men of his
country were named after him, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that story, Ole. We want to hear
the story about yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About myself? Well, last year things didn&#8217;t go
very well with me; the crop of potatoes was rather
short on my farm, and my vessels caught but few fish;
so I decided to make a voyage up the Mediterranean,
to spend the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you go in, Norway?&rdquo; asked Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my boat. We don&#8217;t make voyages on foot
here in Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&#8217;t let me tell my story; so I had better
finish it at once. I got back as far as the North Sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and almost into the Sleeve, when a gale came down
upon me, and strained my boat so that she leaked
badly. I was worn out with fatigue, and dropped
asleep one afternoon. I was dreaming that the King
of Sweden and Norway came off in a big man-of-war,
to welcome me home again. He hailed me himself,
with, &ldquo;Boat, ahoy!&rdquo; which waked me; and then I
saw this ship. You know all the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you went up the Mediterranean
in that old craft?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve told my story, and if you don&#8217;t believe it, you
can look in the almanac, and see whether it is true or
not,&rdquo; laughed Ole. &ldquo;But I must go and show myself
to the captain and the big gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s smart&mdash;isn&#8217;t he?&rdquo; said Sanford, as the
young Norwegian went aft to exhibit himself to the
officers on the quarter deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but what&#8217;s the reason he won&#8217;t tell how
he happened out here in that leaky tub?&rdquo; added
Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know; he wouldn&#8217;t tell the captain, nor
the principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one understands it. Perhaps he has done
something wrong, and is afraid of being found out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s just the fellow for us,&rdquo; said Stockwell, in a
low tone, after he had glanced around him, to see that
no listeners were near. &ldquo;He speaks the lingo of this
country. We must buy him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Boyden. &ldquo;We ought not to
have let him go till we had fixed his flint.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t think of it before; but there is time
enough. If we can get hold of his story we can manage
him without any trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he won&#8217;t tell his story. He wouldn&#8217;t even
let on to the principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter; we must have him, somehow or
other. Sanford can handle him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t exactly believe in the scrape,&rdquo; said Burchmore,
shaking his head dubiously. &ldquo;We&#8217;ve heard all
about the fellows that used to try to run away from
the ship and from the Josephine. They always got
caught, and always had the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not going to run away, and we are not
going to make ourselves liable to any punishment,&rdquo;
interposed Sanford, rather petulantly. &ldquo;We can have
a good time on shore without running away, or anything
of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the use?&rdquo; replied Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The principal isn&#8217;t going to let us see anything at
all of Norway. We are going to put in at Christiansand,
and then go to Christiania. We want to see the
interior of Norway, for there&#8217;s glorious fishing in the
lakes and rivers&mdash;salmon as big as whales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like fishing as well as any fellow, but I don&#8217;t
want to get into a scrape, and have to stay on board
when the whole crowd go ashore afterwards. It
won&#8217;t pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you again, we are not going to run
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see how you can manage it without running
away. You are going into the interior of Norway
on your own hook, without the consent or knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the principal. If you don&#8217;t call this running
away, I don&#8217;t know what you can call it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter what we call it, so long as the principal
don&#8217;t call it running away,&rdquo; argued Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you manage it?&rdquo; inquired Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know yet; and if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t tell a
fellow who has so many doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not go into anything till I understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t ask you to do so. As soon as we come
to anchor, and see the lay of the land, we can tell
exactly what and how to do it. We have plenty of
money, and we can have a first-rate time if you only
think so. Leave it all to me, and I will bring it out
right,&rdquo; continued the confident Sanford, who appeared
to be the leader of the little squad.</p>

<p>The traditions of the various runaways who had, at
one time and another, attempted to escape from the
wholesome discipline and restraint of the Academy,
were current on board all the vessels of the squadron.
The capture of the Josephine, and her cruise in the
English Channel, had been repeated to every new
student who joined the fleet, till the story was as
familiar to the present students as to those of five
years before. There were just as many wild and
reckless boys on board now as in the earlier days of
the institution, and they were as sorely chafed by the
necessary restraints of good order as their predecessors
had been. Perhaps it was natural that, visiting a
foreign country, they should desire to see all they
could of its wonders, and even to look upon some
things which it was the policy of the principal to prevent
them from seeing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Whenever any of the various stories of the runaways
were related, Sanford, Rodman, Stockwell, and
others of similar tendencies, were always ready to
point out the defects in the plan of the operators.
They could tell precisely where Wilton, Pelham, and
Little had been weak, as they termed it, and precisely
what they should have done to render the enterprise a
success. Still, running away, in the abstract, was not
a popular idea in the squadron at the present time;
but Sanford believed that he and his companions
could enjoy all the benefits of an independent excursion
without incurring any of its perils and penalties.
Let him demonstrate his own proposition.</p>

<p>Ole Amundsen walked aft, and was kindly greeted
by the officers on the quarter-deck, who commented
freely upon his improved personal appearance, though
they did it in more refined terms than their shipmates
on the forecastle had done. Some of them tried to
draw from him the explanation of his situation in the
leaky boat, but without any better success than had
attended the efforts of others. He yielded an extravagant
deference to the gold lace on the uniforms of the
officers, treating them with the utmost respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ole, you look better than when I saw you
last,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; and I feel better,&rdquo; replied Ole, bowing
low to the &ldquo;big gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you speak English very well, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you speak Norwegian as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; better, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Badois, will you ask him a question or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
two in Norwegian,&rdquo; added the principal, turning to
the professor of modern languages, who prided himself
on being able to speak fourteen different tongues;
&ldquo;I begin to doubt whether he is a Norwegian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; replied monsieur, who was always
glad of an opportunity to exhibit his linguistic powers.
&ldquo;<em>Hvor staae det til?</em>&rdquo; (How do you do?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Jeg takker, meget vel.</em>&rdquo; (Very well, I thank you),
replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Forstaaer De mig?</em>&rdquo; (Do you understand me?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ja, jeg forstaaer Dem meget vel.</em>&rdquo; (Yes, I understand
you very well.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He speaks Norsk very well,&rdquo; added the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do you, sir,&rdquo; said Ole, with a low bow to
Monsieur Badois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Meget vel</em>,&rdquo; laughed the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied, Ole. Now, have you concluded to
tell me how you happened to be in that boat, so far
from the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waif counted the seams in the quarter-deck,
but nothing could induce him to answer the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given you a suit of clothes, and I desire to
be of service to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir; and a good supper, the best I
ever had, though I have often fished with English
gentlemen, even with lords and sirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will tell me who your friends are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no friends, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lived on shore, or sailed on the sea, with
somebody, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole looked down, and did not deny the proposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now, if you will tell me whom you lived with, I
may be able to do something for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the waif was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berth No. 72 in the steerage is vacant, and I will
give it to you, if I can be sure it is right for me to
do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ole could not, or would not, give any information
on this point, though he was earnest in his desire
to remain in the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ole; as you will not tell me your
story, I shall be obliged to leave you on shore at
Christiansand,&rdquo; said the principal, as he walked
away.</p>

<p>Dr. Winstock also tried to induce the youth to
reveal what he plainly regarded as a secret, but with
no different result. Ole passed from the officers to
the crew again, and with the latter his answers were
like those given to Sanford and his companions. He
invented strange explanations, and told wild stories,
but not a soul on board was the wiser for anything
he said. The waif was permitted to occupy berth
No. 72, but was distinctly assured that he must leave
the ship when she arrived at Christiansand.</p>

<p>The wind continued light during the night, but at
four o&#8217;clock in the morning the squadron was off Gunnarshoug
Point, and not more than four miles from
the land. The shore was fringed with innumerable
islands, which made the coast very picturesque,
though it was exceedingly barren and desolate. Most
of the islands were only bare rocks, the long swells
rolling completely over some of the smaller ones.
The students on deck watched the early sunrise, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
studied the contour of the coast with deep interest,
till it became an old story, and then whistled for a
breeze to take them along more rapidly towards their
port of destination. The fleet was now fully in the
Skager Rack, or Sleeve, as it is also called on the
British nautical charts.</p>

<p>At eight bells, when, with the forenoon watch, commenced
the regular routine of study in the steerage,
all the students had seen the Naze, or Lindersnaes, as
the Norwegians call it&mdash;the southern cape of Norway.
It is a reddish headland, beyond which were
some hills covered with snow in the spring time. Ole
Amundsen remained on deck all day, and had a name
for every island and cliff on the coast. He declared
that he was competent to pilot the ship into the
harbor, for he had often been there. But when the
fleet was off Ox-Oe, at the entrance to the port, a regular
pilot was taken, at three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.
The Josephine and the Tritonia also obtained pilots
soon after. The recitations were suspended in order
to enable the students to see the harbor.</p>

<p>Ole was wanted to explain the various objects
which were presented to the view of the young mariners,
but no one had seen him since the pilot came on
board. All the habitable parts of the vessel were
searched, and the stewards even examined the hold;
but he could not be found. Mr. Lowington was
anxious to see him, to ascertain whether he had
changed his mind in regard to his secret; but Ole had
disappeared as strangely as he had come on board of
the ship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>AN ACCIDENT TO THE SECOND CUTTER.</strong></p>


<p>The gentle breeze from the southward enabled
the fleet to proceed without delay up the fjord
to the town of Christiansand; and, as there was very
little ship&#8217;s duty to be done under such circumstances,
the students had an excellent opportunity to examine
the islands and the main shore. On board the ship
and her two consorts the boys swarmed like bees in
the rigging, eagerly watching every new object that
was presented to their view. As nautical young gentlemen,
they criticised the Norwegian boats and vessels
that sailed on the bay, comparing them with those of
their own country. The two yachts, which were not
restrained by any insurance restrictions, stood boldly
up the fjord, following closely in the wake of the
two schooners.</p>

<p>The course of the vessels up the fjord was through
an archipelago, or &ldquo;garden of rocks,&rdquo; as it is styled
in the Norwegian language. The rocky hills in the
vicinity were of a reddish color, with a few fir trees
upon them. The country was certainly very picturesque,
but the students did not regard it as a very
desirable place of residence. The fleet passed between
the Island of Dybing and the light on Odder&ouml;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and came to anchor in the western harbor. For half
an hour the several crews were occupied in furling
sails, squaring yards, hauling taut the running rigging,
and putting everything in order on board.</p>

<p>The accommodation ladder of the ship, which was
a regular flight of stairs, had hardly been rigged before
a white barge, pulled by four men, came alongside.
The oarsmen were dressed in blue uniform, and
wore tarpaulin hats, upon which was painted the
word &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; indicating the yacht to which they
belonged. The bowman fastened his boat-hook to the
steps, and the rest of the crew tossed their oars in
man-of-war style. In the stern-sheets, whose seats
were cushioned with red velvet plush, were three
persons, all of whom were old friends of our readers.
Captain Paul Kendall, the owner and commander of
the Grace, though he is a few inches taller and a few
pounds heavier than when we last saw him, was
hardly changed in his appearance. Even his side
whiskers and mustache did not sensibly alter his
looks, for his bright eye and his pleasant smile were
still the key to his expression. The Grace carried
the American yacht flag, and her commander wore the
blue uniform of the club to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Three years before, Paul Kendall had experienced
a heavy loss in the death of his mother. She had
inherited a very large fortune, which, however, was
held in trust for her son, until he reached his majority.
At the age of twenty-one, therefore, Paul came to an
inheritance bequeathed by his grandfather, which made
him a <em>millionnaire</em>. His fortune had been carefully
invested by the trustees, and now all he had to do was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to collect and spend his income, of which there was a
considerable accumulation when he attained his majority.
Paul was a young man of high moral and
religious principle. He had never spent a dollar in
dissipation of any kind, and though he knew the
world, he was as child-like and innocent as when he
was an infant.</p>

<p>His tastes were decidedly nautical, and the first
large expenditure from his ample wealth was in the
building of the yacht Grace, which was now anchored
near the Young America. She was a beautiful craft in
every respect, constructed as strong as wood and iron
could make her. As her cabin was to be Paul&#8217;s home
during a portion of the year, it was fitted up with every
appliance of comfort, convenience, and luxury. It
contained a piano, a large library, and every available
means of amusement for the hours of a long passage.
At the age of twenty-one, Paul was more mature in
experience and knowledge than many young men at
twenty-five; and hardly had he been placed in possession
of his inheritance than he sailed for Europe,
and, of course, hastened from Queenstown to Belfast,
where Mr. Arbuckle, father of the lady who occupied
the stern-sheets of the barge, resided. Six months
later he was married to Grace, who still regarded him
as &ldquo;the apple of her eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his return to New York his yacht was finished,
though too late in the season for use that year. Her
first voyage in the spring was to Brockway, which
was the residence of Mr. Lowington, and the headquarters
of the Academy Squadron. Learning that
his old friend the principal was about to sail for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Europe with his charge, he promptly decided to accompany
him, and the Grace was one of the fleet that
crossed the Atlantic in April.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendall was dressed in a plain travelling suit.
She was taller and more mature than when she went
down the Rhine with the Young Americans, but she
was not less beautiful and interesting.</p>

<p>If Fortune had been very kind to Paul Kendall, she
had not been so constant to all who formerly sailed in
the Young America, and who had then basked in her
sunny smile. The third person in the stern-sheets of
the barge was Mr. Augustus Pelham. He was a fine-looking
fellow, with a heavy mustache, dressed like
his commander, in the uniform of the yacht club.
By one of those disasters common in American mercantile
experience, Pelham&#8217;s father had suddenly been
hurled from apparent affluence to real poverty. Being
well advanced in years, he could do nothing better
for himself and his family than to accept a situation as
secretary of an insurance company, which afforded
him a salary only sufficient to enable him to live in
comfort. Augustus had completed his course in the
Academy ship when the change of circumstances compelled
him to abandon all luxurious habits, and work
for his own living. This was by no means a calamity
to him, any more than to other young men. Doubtless
it was annoying to have his allowance of pocket
money suddenly stopped, and to find himself face to
face with one of the sternest realities of life. His
training in the Academy ship had been a blessing to
him, for it had reformed his life, and elevated his
tastes above the low level of dissipation. It had made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a new man of him, besides preparing him for a useful
calling. He was competent, so far as nautical skill
and knowledge were concerned, to command any
vessel to any part of the world, though he lacked the
necessary experience in the management of a miscellaneous
crew, and in the transaction of business. He
was ready to accept a situation as chief or second
mate of a ship, when he happened to meet Paul
Kendall, and was immediately engaged as chief officer
of the Grace, at a salary of one hundred dollars a
month. Another ex-student of the ship, Bennington,
upon whose father fickle Fortune had not continued to
smile, had been appointed second officer. Pelham
had shipped the crew of the Grace, and no better set
of men ever trod a deck.</p>

<p>The barge came up to the steps, and Paul and Pelham
assisted Mrs. Kendall out of the boat, and the
three went upon the deck of the ship. Mr. Lowington,
who had not seen them, except at a distance,
since the fleet sailed from Brockway harbor, gave them
a warm greeting, shaking hands heartily with the
lady first, and then with her companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you looking so well, Mrs. Kendall,&rdquo;
said the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have enjoyed myself every moment of the voyage,
and have never been sick a single hour,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had a fine passage, and there was no
excuse for an old salt like you to be sick,&rdquo; laughed the
principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think we shall go on shore, and stay at a
hotel a few days, just for a change,&rdquo; added Paul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s a good plan; of course you will see more
of the town and the people, than if you remain in
your yacht.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I like the cabin of the yacht better than
any hotel I ever visited,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a change will do you good, my dear,&rdquo; suggested
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you pick up last evening, when you
hove to, Mr. Lowington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We picked up a young Norwegian, about sixteen
years old,&rdquo; answered the principal, detailing the circumstances
under which Ole had been taken on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; asked Paul, looking about
him to obtain a sight of the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We clothed and fed him, and had become quite
interested in him; but just as the pilot came alongside
we missed him. I have had the ship searched for
him, but we have not been able to find him, though
he must be concealed somewhere on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Kendall, glancing
at her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not very strange,&rdquo; continued the principal.
&ldquo;The boy refused to tell us how he came in an
open boat, half full of water, and out of sight of land.
Probably he has run away from his friends, and has
concealed himself to avoid being recognized by the
pilot, or other Norwegian people who may come on
board. I judged by his appearance that he had some
reason for running away from his master or his friends,
for he was only half clothed, in the filthiest rags that
ever covered a human being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like a Norwegian in my yacht, to act as
interpreter for us,&rdquo; added Paul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
&ldquo;I intended to keep him for that purpose myself, if
I could ascertain who his friends were, and make an
arrangement with them, for I will not encourage any
boy in running away from his employers. Very likely
we shall find him again in the course of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir; if you want him, I will look out
for some one on shore,&rdquo; added Paul. &ldquo;At what time
do you pipe to lecture, Mr. Lowington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before to-morrow forenoon, at two bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to hear the lecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Kendall. &ldquo;I think it is
a capital idea to have a professor tell us all about a
country before we attempt to see it. I used to read
about the Norsemen, but I have forgotten all about
them now, and I want to refresh my memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish all our boys had the same view of the
matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will come on board before nine to-morrow
morning, sir,&rdquo; added Paul, as he handed his lady up
the steps over the rail.</p>

<p>Descending to the boat, the three oarsmen shoved
off, and pulled for the shore, where they landed.
The boat had not reached the land, before another
barge, the counterpart of the first, and similarly
manned, left the Feodora, and pulled alongside the ship.
Mr. Robert Shuffles, the owner and commander of
the second yacht, assisted his wife up the ladder to the
deck of the ship, where they were cordially received
by the principal. The yacht Feodora was only six
months older than the Grace, for which she had
served as the model. Shuffles had not come into
possession of any inheritance yet, but his father was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
as liberal as he was wealthy, and gave his son an annual
allowance, which enabled him to marry and keep
a yacht. He and Paul had been intimate friends since
they were graduated from the Academy ship, and
they had made their plans in concert. He had married
Lady Feodora a year before, and she had now
dropped her aristocratic title, and become a republican
lady. Like her husband, she had acquired nautical
tastes, and was even more enthusiastic than he in
anticipating the pleasures of a yacht cruise up the
Baltic, and up the Mediterranean. Shuffles had not
been so fortunate as Paul in finding needy graduates
of the Academy to officer his yacht, and a fat old shipmaster
served as first officer in the Feodora, while the
second mate was a young tar, not yet of age. Having
paid their respects to the principal, the young couple
returned to the boat, and followed Paul to the hotel on
shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the way to go about Europe,&rdquo; said Sanford,
who was sitting on the rail with several of his
shipmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the way?&rdquo; asked Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, as Kendall and Shuffles do it&mdash;in a yacht,
with no Latin and geometry to bother their heads, and
no decks to wash down on a cold morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; but those fellows were the lambs of
the squadron, we are told,&rdquo; laughed Stockwell. &ldquo;They
didn&#8217;t have black marks; didn&#8217;t pick upon the professors,
and didn&#8217;t run away from the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has all that to do with yachting?&rdquo; asked
Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were good boys, and therefore they have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
yachts as their reward,&rdquo; replied Stockwell, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pelham was as good as Shuffles, but he has no
yacht, and has to work on a salary for his living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has the fun of it all the same, and Paul Kendall
will not overwork him. But I haven&#8217;t a word to
say against them. They were all good fellows, if they
were the ship&#8217;s lambs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the second cutters!&rdquo; shouted the boatswain&#8217;s
mate, after his pipe had sounded through the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means us,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;Take your
money and pea-jackets, fellows. Something may turn
up before we come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; replied Stockwell. &ldquo;Pass the word to
all our fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments the fourth cutters appeared in the
waist, with pea-jackets on their arms, and touched
their caps to De Forrest, the fourth lieutenant, who
appeared as the officer detailed to go in the boat,
which now, as formally, was called the professors&#8217;
barge, because it was generally appropriated to the
use of the instructors. It was pulled by eight oarsmen,
and Sanford was the coxswain. The party who
had been considering the plan for an independent excursion
on shore without incurring the perils and penalties
of running away, were the crew of the second
cutter. The fact of being together so much in the
boat, had united them so that they acted and plotted
in concert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with those pea-jackets?&rdquo;
asked De Forrest, when he saw their extra
clothing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&#8217;s rather chilly up here in the evening, and we
thought we might want them, while we were waiting,&rdquo;
replied Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think it is very cold, and as to the evening,
the sun don&#8217;t set till about eight o&#8217;clock,&rdquo; added the
officer, as he went aft to the professors who were going
on shore, and reported that the boat was ready;
for it had already been lowered into the water, and
made fast to the swinging boom.</p>

<p>Her crew went over the side, and seated themselves
in the cutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; said the coxswain, as the stern-sheets of
the barge ranged alongside the little stage at the foot
of the ladder. &ldquo;Up oars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up went the eight oars to a perpendicular position,
where they were held till the boat should be ready
to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Ole is,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; whispered Stockwell, who pulled the bow
oar, shaking his head with energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the coxswain, in
a low tone, for he was very much mystified by the
pantomime of the bow oarsman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; persisted Sanford, who was not
willing to have a secret kept from him even for a moment.</p>

<p>Stockwell pointed into the bottom of the boat, and
then looked up at the sky, with an affectation of
cunning, while the rest of the crew smiled as though
they were in possession of the secret. Sanford said no
more, and joined the bowman in studying the aspect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of the sky. Ole was in the boat to act as guide and
interpreter, and if they chose to leave without running
away, everything seemed to be favorable to the enterprise.
Mr. Mapps and Dr. Winstock presently descended
the steps, and seated themselves in the boat,
followed by De Forrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, coxswain,&rdquo; said the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready! Let fall!&rdquo; said Sanford, as he shoved off
the stern of the cutter. &ldquo;Give way&mdash;together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The well-trained crew bent to their oars, and the
boat shot away from the ship towards the shore. Mr.
Mapps was going to the town to obtain some additional
material for his lecture the following morning,
and the surgeon intended to call on Paul Kendall and
lady at the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a very picturesque town, doctor,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mapps, as he gazed at the high, rocky steeps which
surround Christiansand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very; and I am rather sorry we are not to see
more of the environs of the place,&rdquo; replied the surgeon.
&ldquo;I understand we sail to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say the students will see enough of Norway
before they leave it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to go into the interior,&rdquo; said De Forrest.
&ldquo;There is fine fishing in the streams of Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely Mr. Lowington will take you into
the interior from Christiania,&rdquo; suggested Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t exactly see how it is possible to do so,&rdquo;
added Mr. Mapps. &ldquo;The only conveyance of the
country is the cariole, which seats but one person&mdash;perhaps
two boys; and our squadron has nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
two hundred students. I am afraid there are not
carioles enough in Christiania to carry the whole of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&#8217;s too bad we can&#8217;t have a trial at the
salmon,&rdquo; pouted De Forrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if you waited till July, you might catch
them,&rdquo; replied Mr. Mapps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be contented with trout, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt Mr. Lowington will do the best
he can for you,&rdquo; said Dr. Winstock, as the boat neared
the pier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In, bows!&rdquo; called the coxswain; and the two bowmen
tossed and boated their oars, taking their stations
in the fore-sheets, one of them with the boat-hook in
his hand. &ldquo;Way enough!&rdquo; added Sanford; and the
rest of the crew tossed their oars, and then dropped
them upon the thwarts, with a precision which seemed
to astonish the group of Norwegians on the wharf,
who were observing them.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen landed, and walked up to the
town together, leaving the barge to wait for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Part of you may go on shore for half an hour, if
you wish, and walk about,&rdquo; said De Forrest to his
crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care about going ashore,&rdquo; replied Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; added Stockwell; and so they all
said, very much to the astonishment of the fourth lieutenant,
who naturally supposed that boys who had
been at sea about four weeks would like to stretch
their legs on the solid land for a short time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t any of you wish to go on shore?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Sanford. &ldquo;If you wish to take a
walk, I will push off from the shore, and wait till you
return,&rdquo; said Sanford, very respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s up? You won&#8217;t go on shore, and you
wish me to do so!&rdquo; exclaimed the suspicious officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; protested Sanford. &ldquo;We don&#8217;t
intend to run away. We think that is played out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to do so in this desolate country, I
would let you do it, if I were the principal. But you
are up to some trick, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trick, sir?&rdquo; demanded the coxswain, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know, but it is your next move,&rdquo; replied
De Forrest, as he seated himself, and seemed confident
of his ability to check any mischief which might
be in the minds of his crew. &ldquo;Shove off, bowman!
Up oars! Let fall! Give way together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The oarsmen, rather vexed at the turn of events,
obeyed the several orders, and the boat was again cutting
the still waters of the fjord. All around them were
rocks, with several large and small islands in sight.
In various places on the rocks were affixed iron rings,
to which vessels could make fast in warping out of the
bay when the wind was light or foul. A portion of
the rock to which they were attached was whitewashed,
so that the rings could easily be found, even
in the night. To one of these rings, on a small island
near Odder&ouml;, which commanded a full view of the
landing-place, De Forrest directed the coxswain to
steer the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make fast to that ring,&rdquo; said the officer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; replied the bowman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to land here,&rdquo; added the
lieutenant, in a jeering tone, as though he felt that he
had checkmated his crew in any evil purpose they entertained.
&ldquo;Whether you do or not, I think I shall
stretch my legs on these rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Forrest leaped from thwart to thwart, and then
over the bow upon the island, as though he felt nothing
but contempt for the power of the boat&#8217;s crew to
do mischief. He walked up the rough rocks to the
summit of the islet, where he paused, and for the
first time glanced at his companions, whom he suspected
of harboring some design against the peace
and dignity of the ship. As he did so, he discovered
a steamer, which had just passed through the narrow
opening between Odder&ouml; and the main land, and whose
course lay close to the point of the island where the
cutter was moored. He saw that the swash of the
steamer was likely to throw the boat on the rocks,
and grind her planking upon the sharp points of the
island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the boat!&rdquo; he shouted, lustily. &ldquo;Shove
off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford saw the danger which the lieutenant wished
to avert, and promptly obeyed the orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shove off, Stockwell!&rdquo; he promptly shouted.
&ldquo;Up oars! Stern, all! Give way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stockwell gave a tremendously hard push when he
shoved off, and the cutter shot far out upon the still
waters; in fact, so far that she was forced directly into
the way of the approaching steamer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; yelled the coxswain furiously, when he
saw that he had overdone the matter. &ldquo;Hold water!
Go ahead! Give way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew, even in this moment of deadly peril,&mdash;for
it looked as though, in another instant, they would all
be under the wheels of the steamer,&mdash;obeyed every
command with their wonted precision. But it was a
second too late to take the back track. If the boat had
continued to back as at first, she would probably have
escaped, for the steamer put her helm a-starboard a
little, in order to favor her man&oelig;uvre. When a collision
seemed inevitable, the steamer&#8217;s bell was rung
to stop her, and then to back her.</p>

<p>She struck the cutter; but as her progress had been
powerfully checked, the blow did not carry her under,
though it stove in the side of the boat. The water
poured in through the broken broadside, and the crew
sprang for their lives. They leaped upon the guys
and bob-stays of the steamer, and were hauled in by
the people on the bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of there, Ole,&rdquo; said Stockwell, as
he pulled the boat&#8217;s sail from the extended form of
the waif, who was concealed in the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p>Ole lost not a moment in following the example of
his companions. As the steamer&#8217;s headway had now
been entirely checked, Stockwell held the wrecked
cutter in her position, while Rodman passed the pea-jackets
up to the forecastle of the steamer. Having
done this, they abandoned the boat, and followed the
example of their companions. No one was drowned,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
or even wet above his knees, for the steamer had
struck the boat just hard enough to stave in her side,
without carrying her under.</p>

<p>The Norwegians hooked up the boat&#8217;s painter, and
taking it in tow, proceeded on her course; for the
captain&mdash;as interpreted by Ole&mdash;declared that his
boat carried the mail, and he could not wait for anything.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>NORWAY IN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;Clear away the first cutter!&rdquo; shouted the
first lieutenant of the Young America, from
whose deck the catastrophe to the second cutter had
been observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the first cutters!&rdquo; piped the boatswain, with
an energy inspired by the stirring occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was very carelessly done,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington,
whose attention had been called to the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The steamer ran within a couple of rods of the
island,&rdquo; added Captain Cumberland. &ldquo;I saw the
fourth lieutenant order the boat to shove off; I suppose
he did it to prevent the swash of the steamer
from grinding the cutter on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he doing among those rocks?&rdquo; asked
the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know, sir. He landed Mr. Mapps and
the doctor, and was ordered to wait for them. I don&#8217;t
see why he went over to that island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second lieutenant was directed to take charge
of the first cutter; Peaks, the adult boatswain, and
Bitts, the carpenter, were ordered to go also, to render
any assistance which might be required in succoring
the stove boat. The cutter shoved off, her twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
oars struck the water together, and the crew gave
way with an energy which caused their oars to bend
like twigs, while the barge leaped through the water
as though it was some monster of the deep goaded to
his utmost to escape the wrath of a more potent
pursuer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a will, my lads!&rdquo; shouted the coxswain.
&ldquo;Steady! Keep the stroke, but use your muscle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a job for you, Bitts,&rdquo; said the boatswain,
as the Norwegian took the second cutter in
tow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a heavy job it will be, too,&rdquo; replied Bitts.
&ldquo;I wonder there is anything left of the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The steamer stopped her wheels, and backed
some time before she struck, or there would not have
been much left of the boat, or her crew,&rdquo; added Peaks.
&ldquo;Thank God, the boys are all safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a lucky escape for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was; and we needn&#8217;t say anything about the
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The steamer is going ahead,&rdquo; said the carpenter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter for that, so long as the boys are all
safe,&rdquo; replied Peaks.</p>

<p>The people in the steamer seemed to take no notice
of the first cutter, appearing not to understand that it
had come out for the wrecked crew. But as the boat
pulled towards her, she cast off the cutter in tow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steamer, ahoy!&rdquo; shouted Norwood, the second
lieutenant, as he saw the cutter cast adrift.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but hoisted a flag, on which
appeared the word &ldquo;Post,&rdquo; with something else which
none in the first cutter could understand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
&ldquo;She&#8217;s a mail boat,&rdquo; said the boatswain; &ldquo;and I
suppose she intends to say she is in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she mean to carry off the crew of that boat?&rdquo;
demanded the second lieutenant, not a little vexed at
the conduct of the Norwegians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will not carry them far,&rdquo; suggested Dunlap,
the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may take them to Bergen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, sir. If she is a mail steamer, she
stops at all the ports on the coast. I don&#8217;t think she
will carry them far. Very likely they will be sent
back, on some other steamer, before night,&rdquo; added
Dunlap, who had studied the coast of Norway more
carefully than the lieutenant in command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First cutter, ahoy!&rdquo; shouted De Forrest, on the
island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On shore!&rdquo; replied Norwood. &ldquo;We can&#8217;t catch
the steamer&mdash;that is certain; steer for the island,
coxswain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first cutter ran up to the rocky island, and as
soon as the bow touched the rocks, De Forrest leaped
into the fore-sheets. He was nervous and excited,
feeling, perhaps, that he had failed in his duty, and
was, therefore, responsible for the accident to the
second cutter. From feeling that he had circumvented
his crew in carrying out some unexplained trick,
he realized that he had led them into a trap, from
which they had narrowly escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing on this island, De Forrest?&rdquo;
asked Norwood, as the discomfited officer took his
place in the stern-sheets, and the boat shoved off again.</p>

<p>The second lieutenant declared that he had come over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to the island to prevent his crew from running away,
or from carrying out some trick whose existence he
suspected, but whose nature he could not comprehend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanford wanted I should go ashore at the town,
and offered to look out for the crew while I did so,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;Of course I wouldn&#8217;t leave my crew;
but I told them that half of them might go on shore and
take a walk. None of them wanted to go, and then I
was satisfied they were up to something. I went on
the island for the sole purpose of watching them. I
wanted to know what their plan was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you discover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. I saw that steamer coming, and I
ordered Sanford to shove off, so that her swash should
not damage the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe they intended to play any trick,&rdquo;
added Norwood. &ldquo;You are too suspicious, De Forrest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am; but fellows that have been at sea
for a month are rather glad of a chance to stretch
their legs on shore. They wouldn&#8217;t do so, when I
told them they might; and I don&#8217;t believe such a
thing was ever heard of before. Besides, they all
looked as though they were up to something, and
just as though they had a big secret in their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were right, but I don&#8217;t believe you
were,&rdquo; said Norwood, too bluntly for good manners,
and too bluntly for the harmony of the officers&#8217; mess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am responsible for the smashing of
the second cutter, but I was trying to do my duty,&rdquo;
replied De Forrest, vexed at the implied censure of his
superior.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
&ldquo;If you had staid at the pier this could not have
happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But something else might have happened; and if
my crew had run away, I should have been blamed
just as much,&rdquo; growled the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were too sharp for your own good&mdash;that is
all. But I don&#8217;t mean to blame you, De Forrest,&rdquo;
said Norwood, with a patronizing smile. &ldquo;Perhaps I
should have done the same thing if I had been in your
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by to lay on your oars!&rdquo; shouted the coxswain,
as the boat approached the water-logged second
cutter. &ldquo;Oars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew stopped pulling, and levelled their oars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In, bows! Stand by the boat-hooks!&rdquo; continued
the coxswain; and the two forward oarsmen grasped
the boat-hooks, and took their station in the fore-sheets.
&ldquo;Hold water.&rdquo; And the ten oars dropped into the
water as one, checking the onward progress of the
cutter.</p>

<p>The bowmen fastened to the second cutter, and
recovering her painter, passed it astern to the coxswain,
who made it fast to a ring on the stern-board.
By this time the steamer, with the luckless crew of
the stove boat, had disappeared behind an island.
The first cutter pulled back to the ship, and De Forrest
immediately reported to the first lieutenant, and
explained his conduct in presence of the principal and
the captain. He detailed his reasons for supposing
his crew intended to run away, or to play some trick
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have done all that a careful and vigilant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
officer could, De Forrest; and so far as I can see,
you are free from blame,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>The fourth lieutenant glanced at Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; added the latter, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you made any mistake, it was in leaving your
boat at the island,&rdquo; continued the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just exactly my sentiments,&rdquo; whispered Norwood.
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t blame the fourth lieutenant, but I shouldn&#8217;t
have done just as he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is that steamer bound?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lowington
of the pilot, who had not yet left the ship, and
was really waiting to be invited to supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Christiania, sir,&rdquo; replied the pilot, who, like
all of his class on the coast of Norway, spoke a little
English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does she stop next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Lillesand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two miles! Why, it is farther than that to the
sea,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means Norwegian miles,&rdquo; suggested one of
the instructors, who was listening with interest to the
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True; I did not think of that. A Norwegian
mile is about seven English miles. It is fourteen
miles, then, to Lillesand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the assistance of Professor Badois, who acted
as interpreter, the pilot explained that the steamer
which had just left was several hours late, and would
go that night to Frederiksv&aelig;rn, where the steamers
from Bergen and Christiania made connections with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the boat for Gottenburg and Copenhagen. The Christiania
steamer would reach Christiansand the next
evening, and the boys who had been carried away
could return in her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did she carry them off? It would not have
taken five minutes to land them,&rdquo; added the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was very late, and her passengers for Gottenburg
and Copenhagen would lose the steamer at Frederiksv&aelig;rn
if she does not arrive in season,&rdquo; the pilot
explained through Professor Badois.</p>

<p>But Mr. Lowington was so grateful that the crew
of the second cutter had all escaped with their lives,
that he was not disposed to be very critical over the
conduct of the Norwegian steamer. The boys were
safe, and would return the next night at farthest.
The accident was talked about, during the rest of the
day, on board of all the vessels of the squadron. The
officers and seamen on board of the ship had witnessed
the accident, and had seen all the crew of the
second cutter go over the bows of the steamer. They
had not observed, in the excitement of the moment,
that ten, instead of nine, had left the wrecked boat;
and as Ole Amundsen was dressed precisely like the
crew, his presence in the cutter was not even suspected.</p>

<p>The first cutter was sent to the town for Dr. Winstock
and Mr. Mapps, and in an hour or two the
excitement had entirely subsided. The routine of the
ship went on as before, and as there was little work
to be done, the absentees were hardly missed.</p>

<p>At half past eight the next morning, the signal,
&ldquo;All hands, attend lecture,&rdquo; was flying on board of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Young America. The boats from the Josephine and
the Tritonia came alongside the ship, bringing all the
officers and crews of those vessels. Paul Kendall and
lady, and their friends, were brought off from the
shore; Shuffles and his wife also appeared, and a further
delegation from each of the yachts asked admission
to the ship to hear the lecture, or rather to attend
the exercise in geography and history, for the occasion
was even less formal than on the first cruise of the
ship. The steerage was crowded, after the boatswain
had piped the call, and Mr. Mapps was doubtless duly
flattered by the number of his audience. On the foremast
hung a large map of Sweden and Norway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, young gentlemen, we will begin
with Scandinavia,&rdquo; said the professor, taking his place
near the foremast, with the pointer in his hand. &ldquo;What
was Scandinavia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancient name of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,&rdquo;
replied one of the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The barbarous tribes from the northern part of
Europe at different times invaded the southern sections,
conquering various other tribes, occupying their
territory, and thus mingling with all the people from
whom originated the present nations of Europe.
Thus, in remote ages, the Scandinavians, among
others, by their conquests and their emigration, have
contributed largely to the modern elements of society.
With this explanation we will look at Scandinavia in
detail, beginning with Norway. Between what degrees
of latitude does it lie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between forty and ninety,&rdquo; replied an enthusiastic
youth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
&ldquo;True&mdash;quite right; and a safe answer. If you
had said between one and ninety, the answer would
have been just as good for any other country as for
Norway. I would like to have the jacket fit a little
closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between fifty-eight and seventy-one, north,&rdquo; answered
one who was better posted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly right; about the same latitude as Greenland,
and our newly-acquired Alaska. Our ship is
anchored in the same parallel as the northern part of
Labrador, and one degree south of the southern point
of Greenland. But it is not as &lsquo;cold as Greenland,
here,&rsquo; the temperature being some twelve degrees
milder, because the warm waters of the Gulf Stream
are discharged upon its shores. You know its boundaries.
It is one thousand and eighty miles from the
Naze to the North Cape, and varies from forty to two
hundred and seventy miles in width. How many
square miles has it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundred and twenty-three thousand square
miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a little larger than the six New England States,
New York, and New Jersey united. The country is
mountainous, and abounds in picturesque scenery.
Precipices, cataracts, and rushing torrents are very
numerous in the central and northern parts. The
V&ouml;ringfos is a waterfall, and the Rjukanfos, near
the central part, are cataracts of about nine hundred
feet perpendicular descent; but of course the volume
of water is not very large. The highest mountains
are between eight and nine thousand feet high. Norway
has an abundance of rivers, but none of them are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
very long. The coast, as you have seen, is fringed
with islands, which, with the numerous indentations,
form a vast number of bays, straits, channels, and
sounds, which are called <em>fjords</em> here. One of the
principal of these is Christiania Fjord, which you will
ascend in a few days. The country also abounds in
lakes, which, as in most mountainous regions, are
very narrow, being simply the widenings of the rivers.
The largest of these is Mi&ouml;sen Lake, fifty-five miles
long, and from one to twelve wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soil is not very good, and the Norwegians
are not progressive farmers. They cling to the
methods of their sires, and modern improvements
find but little favor among them. The winter is long,
and the summer short; but by a provision of provident
nature, the crops mature more rapidly than in some
of the southern climes, as grain has been reaped six
weeks after it was sowed. The principal crops are
the grains; but the supply is not equal to the demand,
and considerable importations are received from Denmark
and Russia. In the south the farmers devote
themselves to stock-raising, while in the north the
Lapps derive nearly all the comforts of life from the
reindeer, the care of which is their chief industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The extensive product of pine and fir have created
a vast trade in lumber, which constitutes three
fourths of the exports to the United Kingdom, and a
considerable portion of the inhabitants in the wooded
districts are employed in cutting, sawing, and sending
to market the wealth of the forests. Next in importance
to this are the fisheries, which yield about five
million dollars a year. Cod, haddock, and herring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
are cured for exportation, and are an important source
of revenue. Besides these, the roe of the cod is sent
to France, Italy, and Spain, as bait for sardines.
Norway supplies London with lobsters. Norway
iron, as well as Swedish, is very celebrated; but the
mines are poorly managed, as are those of copper and
silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kingdom of Norway is divided into eighteen
provinces, which are called Amts. Its population, in
1865, was one million seven hundred thousand, showing
an increase of about two hundred thousand in
ten years. The government is a constitutional monarchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a part of Sweden,&rdquo; said one of
the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. The King of Sweden is also the King
of Norway; but each country has its own independent
and separate government. Each has its own
legislature, makes its own laws, and raises and expends
its own revenues. The king exercises his
functions as ruler over both kingdoms through a
council of state, composed of an equal number of
Swedes and Norwegians, whose duty it is to advise
the sovereign, and, in accordance with a peculiar feature
of monarchy, to take the responsibility when any
blunder is made; for &ldquo;the king can do no wrong.&rdquo; If
anything is wrong, some one else did it. Having
the same king, who rules over each nation separately,
is the only connection between Norway and Sweden.
The former pays about one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars of his civil list, and he is obliged to reside
in Norway during a small portion of each year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
&ldquo;The constitution of Norway is one of the most
democratic in Europe. The legislative and part of
the executive power is vested in the Storthing, which
means the &lsquo;great court,&rsquo; composed of the representatives
of the people. The king has but little power,
though he has a limited veto upon the acts passed by
the legislative body. He can create no order of nobility,
or grant any titles or dignities. The members of
the Storthing are elected indirectly by the people; and
when they assemble, they divide themselves into two
houses, corresponding to our Senate and House of Representatives.
All acts must pass both chambers, and
in case of disagreement, the two bodies come together,
and discuss the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The religion of Norway is Lutheran, and few of
any other sect are to be found; formerly, no other was
tolerated, but now religious freedom prevails, though
Jesuits and monks of any order are sternly excluded.
The clergy, who are generally very well educated,
have an average income of about a thousand dollars
a year, and I think are better paid than even in our
own country. The people are well instructed, and
one who cannot read and write is seldom found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The early history of Norway is that of most of
the countries of Europe&mdash;a powerful chief subjugated
his neighbors, and united the tribes into a nation.
Harold the Fair-haired, whose father had conquered
the southern part of the country, fell in love with
Gyda, the daughter of a petty king, who refused to
wed him till he had absolute sway over the entire
country. Pleased with the lady&#8217;s spirit, he vowed
never to cut or comb his hair till all Norway lay at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
his feet. It appears that he eventually had occasion
for his barber&#8217;s services, and wedded the lady. This
was in the ninth century; and the victories of Harold
drove many of the Norsemen, or Northmen, to seek
their fortunes in other lands. They discovered and
colonized Greenland and Iceland, and even established
settlements on the continental portion of North America.
Traces of them have been found on the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, and some claim that they founded settlements
farther south. They figure largely in the early
history of England and Scotland, and even carried
their piratical arms into Russia, Flanders, France,
Italy, and other territories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A son of Harold, who had been educated in England,
brought Christianity into Norway; but, it was
three centuries before the new faith had established
itself. Like the Hindoos, Greeks, and Romans, the
ancient Scandinavians had a mythology, upon which
their religion was based. They believed that in the
beginning all was chaos, in which was a fountain that
sent forth twelve rivers. These streams flowed so far
from their source that the waters froze, and the ice,
defying the modern law of nature, sank till the fathomless
deep was filled up. Far south of the world of
mist, in which this miracle was wrought, was a world
of fire and light, whence proceeded a hot wind that
melted the ice, from the drops of which came the ice-giant,
whose name was Ymir, and from whom proceeded
a race of ice-giants. From the wedding of the
ice and heat of the two extremes of the world came a
cow, from which ran four streams of milk, the food
of the ice-giants. While this wonderful beast was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
licking the salt stones in the ice, which formed her
diet, a quantity of human hair grew out of them, and
the next day a human head was developed, and then
appeared a whole man. B&ouml;r, the son of this man,
married a daughter of one of the ice-giants, and they
had three children, the oldest of whom was Odin,
who became the rulers of heaven and earth, because
they were all good, while the children of Ymir, the
ice-giant, were evil. Then, as now, the Good and the
Evil were at war. Finally the ice-giant was slain, and
being thrown into space, the world was created from
his body; his blood forming the sea and the rivers;
his flesh the earth; his hair the grass; his bones the
rocks; his teeth and broken jaws the stones; and of
his head the heavens, at the four ends of which were
placed four dwarfs, called North, South, East, and
West. Of this giant&#8217;s brains, thrown into the air,
they formed the clouds, while of the sparks from the
land of fire were made the stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the sons of B&ouml;r, who, you must remember,
were the gods of heaven and earth, were walking on
the shore of the sea, they discovered two blocks,
whereof they created a man and a woman. Odin
gave them life and souls, while his brothers endowed
them with other human faculties and powers. Odin
was the Jupiter, the chief, of the northern gods. He
is the god of song and of war, and was the inventor
of the Runic characters, or alphabet. He was the
ruler of Valhalla, the home of heroes slain in battle.
There is much more that is curious and interesting in
the mythology of the Scandinavians, which I must
ask you to read for yourselves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
&ldquo;Olaf II. propagated Christianity with fire and
sword. He demolished the temples of paganism, and
founded Trondhjem, or Drontheim, as it is called on our
maps. His successor, St. Olaf, followed his example, till
his cruelty excited a rebellion, and Canute the Great,
of Denmark, landing in Norway, was elected king.
Olaf fled into Sweden, where he organized an army,
and attempted to recover his throne; but he was defeated
and slain in a battle near Trondhjem. His body
was found, a few years later, in a perfect state of preservation,
which was regarded as a miracle, and Olaf
was canonized as a saint. His remains are said to
have wrought many miracles, and up to the time of the
Reformation, thousands of pilgrims annually visited his
shrine at Trondhjem. Even in London churches were
dedicated to this saint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Canute gave Norway to his son Sweyn, who, upon
the death of his father, was dispossessed of the throne
by Magnus I., the son of St. Olaf. He was succeeded
by Harold III., a great warrior, who founded Osloe,
now Christiania. After Olaf III. and Magnus III.
came Sigurd, who, in 1107, made a pilgrimage of four
years to Jerusalem, with a fleet of sixty vessels, and
distinguished himself in the holy wars. His death was
followed by civil dissensions, until Hako IV. obtained
the throne. He lost his life in an attempt to retain
the Hebrides Islands, claimed by Scotland. Then
war with Denmark, the monopoly of trade by the
Hanse towns, and a fearful plague, which depopulated
whole sections, produced a decline in the national
prosperity of Norway. Hako VI., who died in 1380,
had married the daughter of the King of Denmark,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and the crown of Norway descended to his son, Olaf
III., of Denmark, in whom the sovereignties of Norway
and Denmark were united. Olaf was succeeded
by his mother Margaret, celebrated in history as &lsquo;the
Semiramis of the North.&rsquo; She conquered Sweden,
and annexed it to her own dominions. By the &lsquo;Union
of Calmar,&rsquo; signed by the principal nobles and prelates
of the three Scandinavian kingdoms, the three
crowns were united in one person, the subjects of each
to have equal rights. This compact was disregarded,
and Norway was hopelessly oppressed by the ruler.
The Union, however, continued till 1623; but Norway
was subject to Denmark till 1814.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the allied powers of Europe, which were
engaged in putting down the first Napoleon, rearranged
the map of Europe, the destiny of Norway
was changed. Russia wanted Finland, and she offered
Norway in compensation for it to Sweden, with the
further condition that Bernadotte should join the allies.
He accepted the terms, and the King of Denmark was
compelled, by force of arms, to cede Norway to
Sweden. The Norwegians would not submit to the
change, and declared their independence. Prince
Christian, of Denmark, who was then governor general
of Norway, called a convention of the people at
Eidsvold, and a new constitution was framed, and
the prince elected King of Norway. Bernadotte
invaded Norway with a Swedish army, while the
allies blockaded the coast. Resistance was hopeless,
and as Sweden offered favorable terms, Christian abdicated,
and an arrangement was immediately effected.
The constitution was accepted by the king, and Norway
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
became an independent nation, united to Sweden
under one king. Bernadotte became King of Sweden
and Norway under the title of Charles XIV., John.
He refused the Norwegians a separate national flag;
but when he attempted to alter the constitution to suit
his own views, the Storthing resolutely and successfully
resisted his interference. This body abolished
titles of nobility&mdash;an act which the king vetoed; but
three successive Storthings passed the law, and thus, by
the constitution, made it valid in spite of the veto. The
Norwegians were not to be intimidated even by the
appearance of a military force, and have ever been
jealous to the last degree of their rights and privileges
as a nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bernadotte was succeeded by his son Oscar I.,
who gave the Norwegians a separate national flag; and
he flattered the vanity of the people by allowing himself
to be styled the &lsquo;King of Norway and Sweden&rsquo; in
all public acts relating to Norway, instead of &lsquo;Sweden
and Norway.&rsquo; In 1859, Oscar was succeeded by his
son Charles XV., who is now the King of Sweden and
Norway. In the history of Denmark and Sweden,
more will be said of this kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In French, Norway is <em>Norv&egrave;ge</em>; in German, <em>Norwegen</em>;
in Spanish, <em>Noruega</em>; and <em>Norge</em> in the Scandinavian
languages. Now, I dare say you would like
to visit the shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor closed his remarks, and the several
boatswains piped away their crews.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>MR. CLYDE BLACKLOCK AND MOTHER.</strong></p>


<p>Belonging to the squadron were fourteen
boats, ranging from the twelve-oar barge down
to the four-oar cutter. In the waters of Brockway
harbor, rowing had been the principal exercise of the
students, though the daily evolutions in seamanship
were well calculated to develop the muscles and harden
the frame. They had been carefully trained in
the art, and, enjoying the amusement which it afforded,
they were apt scholars. As the safety of the squadron
and the saving of life at sea might often depend upon
the skill with which the boats were handled, the principal
devoted a great deal of attention to this branch
of nautical education. To give an additional zest to
the exercise, he had occasionally offered prizes at the
boat-races which the students were encouraged to
pull; and the first cutter was now in possession of
a beautiful silk flag, won by the power of the crew in
rowing.</p>

<p>Every boy in the squadron was a swimmer. In the
summer season this accomplishment had been taught
as an art, an hour being devoted to the lesson every
day, if the weather was suitable. Cleats, the adult
boatswain of the Josephine, was the &ldquo;professor&rdquo; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the art, having been selected for the responsible position
on account of his remarkable skill as a swimmer.
The boys were trained in diving, floating, swimming
under water, and taught to perform various evolutions.
Not alone in the tranquil bay were they educated to
the life of the fishes, but also in the surf, and among
the great waves. They were taught to get into a boat
from the water in a heavy sea. A worn-out old longboat
had done duty during the preceding summer as a
wreck, in order to familiarize the students with the
possibilities of their future experience. It was so prepared
that a portion of its planking could be suddenly
knocked out, and the boat almost instantly filled with
water; and the problem was, to meet this emergency
in the best manner. Other boats were at hand in case
of a real accident, or if any naturally timid fellow lost
his presence of mind. While the &ldquo;wreck,&rdquo; as the
practice boat was called, was moving along over the
waves, pulled by half a dozen boys, Cleats, without
warning or notice of his intention, opened the aperture
near her keel. Sometimes she was loaded with
stones, so that she went to the bottom like a rock,
though this part of the programme was always carried
out on a beach, where the receding tide would enable
the professor to recover the boat. The crew were then
to save themselves by swimming ashore, or to another
boat. Sometimes, also, the &ldquo;wreck&rdquo; was loaded with
broken spars, pieces of board, and bits of rope; and
the problem was for the crew to construct a raft in the
water, often in a rough sea. All these exercises, and
many others, were heartily enjoyed by the boys, and a
ringing cheer always announced the safety of a crew,
either on the shore, in a boat, or on the raft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Many persons, and even those who are tolerable
swimmers, have been drowned simply by the loss of
their presence of mind. The dashing of the waves,
or the great distance of the land or other place of
safety, intimidates them, and they are unable to use
their powers. But the students of the squadron were
gradually and carefully accustomed to the water, so
that they could swim a reasonable distance without
wearing themselves out, could rest their limbs by
floating, and were taught to avail themselves of any
expedient to secure their safety. If a boat was stove
on the rocks in a surf, or was run down by a vessel,
the fact of being in the water did not frighten them
out of their wits, for they had been trained to feel quite
at home, as in their native element. They were actually
drilled to confront danger in every imaginable
form. But a gentle and timid boy was not pitched
into the water, even after he had learned to swim. His
constitutional shrinking was slowly and skilfully overcome,
so that even the most delicate&mdash;though but few
such ever found their way into the ranks of the squadron&mdash;took
to the water as a pastime. Of course the
degree of proficiency in the art of swimming, and of
the acquired ability to meet danger in the water, differed
very widely in different boys; but all were accustomed
to the waves, and, in a measure, to leading
the life of a duck or a fish.</p>

<p>The crews of the several boats piped over the side,
and took their places, the rest of the students being
distributed in the barges and cutters, till only the adult
officers remained in the ship. Each one, as it was
loaded, pulled off, and took its station in the order in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
which the boat squadron usually moved. The commodore&#8217;s
barge and the ship&#8217;s first cutter, each twelve
oars, led the van, while the other boats came in four
ranks of three each. All the boats carried the American
flag at the stern, and each one had its number at
the bow. All the Young America&#8217;s boats had their
numbers on a white, the Josephine&#8217;s on a green, and
the Tritonia&#8217;s on a blue flag.</p>

<p>The tactics of the boat squadron were many and
various, which had been adopted more to give interest
to the exercise than for any inherent utility.
These movements were regulated by signals from the
commodore&#8217;s barge. Mr. Lowington had decided to
make an excursion among the islands in the Fjord before
dinner, and visit the town in the afternoon. A
pilot was put in the commodore&#8217;s barge, and Captain
Cumberland, as acting flag officer, was in command
of the squadron. The principal and Professor Badois
were passengers in his barge.</p>

<p>The cutters were formed in their usual array, and
the two boats from the yachts brought up the rear.
The signal officer, who was a quartermaster from the
ship, at the order of the captain, elevated the white
flag crossed with red, with which all the signals were
made. The coxswains of the several boats could
see this flag, while the oarsmen could not, being
back to the barge, and not allowed to look behind
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; said each coxswain, as soon as the signal
appeared.</p>

<p>At this command the several crews, who had been
laying on their oars, prepared for the stroke. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
signal officer dropped the flag to the port side of the
barge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; added each coxswain; and the boat
squadron moved off.</p>

<p>In order to keep the lines full, the larger quarter
boat of the Grace had been borrowed and manned,
and now took the place of the second cutter, which
had been stove, and upon which the three carpenters
of the squadron were now at work, making the necessary
repairs. The fleet made a splendid appearance,
with the flags flying, and with the officers and crews
in their best uniforms. The people on the shore, and
on board of the various vessels in the harbor, gathered
to see the brilliant array. The crew of an English
steamer cheered lustily, and the lady passengers waved
their handkerchiefs. Suddenly the signal on the commodore&#8217;s
barge went up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by to toss!&rdquo; said the several coxswains, as
the fleet of boats came abreast of the steamer, which
was the Orlando, bound from Hull to Christiania.</p>

<p>The signal went down to the port side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toss!&rdquo; continued the coxswains, only loud
enough to be heard by the crews, for they had been
taught that the unnecessary screaming of orders makes
an officer seem ridiculous, and injures the effect of the
man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>At the word every oar went up, and was held perpendicularly
in the air with the left hand. A bugle
blast from the barge at this moment brought every student
to his feet, with his right hand to his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One!&rdquo; said the coxswain of each boat, at a dip of
the signal flag.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
A rousing cheer, accompanied by a swing of the
cap, followed, and was twice repeated, making up the
complement of the three cheers, in return for the salutations
of the steamer&#8217;s people. Her crew returned
the compliment in like manner. At another blast of
the bugle, the crews were seated with their oars still
up. Again the signal in the barge was elevated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by!&rdquo; said the coxswains, which was only a
warning to be ready.</p>

<p>The flag dropped to port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let fall!&rdquo; added the coxswain; and all the oars
dropped into the water together, while the flag was again
elevated. &ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; and the stroke was resumed.</p>

<p>The passengers of the Orlando clapped their hands
vigorously, as they witnessed the perfection of the
movements. The fleet proceeded up the bay towards
the west front of the town, where a considerable collection
of people had assembled to witness the novel
parade. The barge led the way to the extreme west
of the bay, where the signal flag was again exhibited,
and then swung first to the port and then to the starboard.
This was the signal for coming into single
line, and the coxswain of each boat gave the orders
necessary to bring it into range. It was so managed
that each boat came into the new order as it turned to
pass in front of the town; so that they proceeded in
a single line before the people, but not more than
twenty feet apart. Once more the signal flag appeared,
with a double motion upwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by to lay on your oars!&rdquo; said the coxswains.
&ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; they continued, as the flag swung
down to starboard. &ldquo;Hold water!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
These orders soon brought the boats to a stand.
The signal flag moved in a horizontal circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull, starboard; back, port. Give way!&rdquo; continued
the coxswains; and the effect of this evolution was
to turn the boats as on a pivot. &ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; and the crew
ceased pulling, with their oars all on a level, and the
blades feathered.</p>

<p>The boats had been turned half round, and each
coxswain aligned his own by the barge on the right.
In this position three cheers were given in compliment
to the people on the shore, though the Norwegians
seemed to be too dull and heavy to comprehend
the nature of the movement. The boats swung again,
and continued on their way, in single line, through
the narrow passage between Odder&ouml; and the main
land. Under the direction of the native pilot, the
barge led the way among the islands, affording the
students an opportunity to see the shores. When the
fleet came into the broad channel, the order was resumed,
as at first, and after various man&oelig;uvres, it was
dismissed, each boat returning to the vessel to which
it belonged.</p>

<p>The appearance of the fleet, including the two beautiful
yachts, and the evolutions of the boats, had created
a decided sensation on board of the Orlando,
which was crowded with passengers, most of them
tourists on their way to the interior of Norway. The
crews of the several vessels piped to dinner as soon
as they returned from the excursion; but the meal was
hardly finished before visitors from the steamer began
to arrive, and the boatmen in the harbor made a good
harvest on the occasion. Among those who came to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the ship was an elegantly dressed lady, with her son
and daughter, attended by a servant man in livery.
Mrs. Garberry Blacklock was duly presented to the
principal by one of the gentlemen who had introduced
himself. She was evidently a very fine lady; for she
was &ldquo;distinguished&rdquo; in her manners as well as in
her dress. And her son, Clyde Blacklock, was as evidently
a very fine young gentleman, though he was
only fourteen years of age. It is doubtful whether
Miss Celia Blacklock could be regarded as a very fine
young lady, for she appeared to be very pretty, and
very modest and retiring, with but a very moderate
estimate of her own importance.</p>

<p>For the tenth time Mr. Lowington briefly explained
the nature of the institution over which he presided;
and the fine lady listened with languishing <em>ennui</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is a very rough life for young gentlemen,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Blacklock. &ldquo;I should fancy they
would become very, <em>very</em> rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; replied the principal. &ldquo;We
intend that the students shall behave like gentlemen,
and we think the discipline of the ship has a tendency
to promote good manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must live like sailors, and sailors are very,
<em>very</em> rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily, madam. There is nothing in the
occupation itself that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish to know what the fellows do,&rdquo; interposed
Mr. Clyde Blacklock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in the occupation itself that
begets rudeness,&rdquo; added Mr. Lowington, giving no
attention to the young gentleman, who had so impolitely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
broken in upon the conversation of his elders.
&ldquo;I see no reason why a young man cannot be a gentleman
in a ship as well as on shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you have sailors to do the dirty work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam; our students do all the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they put their own fingers into the pitch and
the tar?&rdquo; inquired the lady, with a curl of the lip
which indicated her horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but we think pitch and tar are not half
so defiling as evil thoughts and bad manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are very, <em>very</em> disagreeable. The odor of
tar and pitch is intolerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not find it so, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, I wish to know what the fellows do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are accustomed to the odor of them,&rdquo; continued
the principal. &ldquo;To some people the scent of
musk, and even otto of roses, is not pleasant; and,
for my part, I rather enjoy that of tar and pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very, <em>very</em> singular. But Clyde desires to
know what the young gentlemen do,&rdquo; added the lady,
glancing at her son, behind whom stood the man in
livery, as though he were the boy&#8217;s exclusive property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have a regular routine of study,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Lowington, addressing the lady, and declining
even to glance at the original inquirer, for the rudeness
of Mr. Clyde in interrupting the conversation
seemed to merit a rebuke. &ldquo;They attend to the
studies usually pursued in the highest class of academies,
including the modern languages and navigation,
the latter being a speciality in the course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care what they study,&rdquo; said Clyde. &ldquo;What
do they do in the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
&ldquo;We prepare boys for college, and beyond that
pursue a regular college course, so far as our facilities
will permit. Our students have the advantage of
travel; for, in the present cruise, we shall visit all the
principal nations of Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they do in the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clyde desires to know what the boys do in the
ship,&rdquo; added the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They learn good manners, for the first thing,
madam. There are fifteen officers in this vessel, and
nine in each of the others. They are all students, who
take their rank according to their merit. The best
scholar in each is the captain, and so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the captain manage the ship?&rdquo; asked Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to be the captain,&rdquo; exclaimed the
young gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could manage the ship?&rdquo;
asked his mother, with a smile which expressed the
pride she felt in the towering ambition of her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could, if any fellow could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clyde is very fond of the sea; indeed, he worries
me sadly by his adventurous spirit,&rdquo; said his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would do him good to go to sea,&rdquo; added
the principal, rather dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The students made a beautiful appearance in their
boats to-day,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Blacklock. &ldquo;It was
really very, <em>very</em> wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They handle the boats very well indeed, but their
skill was only acquired by long and careful training.
As we have a considerable number of visitors on
board, madam, we will show you a little seamanship.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Captain Cumberland,&rdquo; he added, turning to the young
commander, who had been making himself agreeable
to Miss Celia Blacklock.</p>

<p>The captain asked the young lady to excuse him,
and stepping up to the principal, bowed gracefully,
and raised his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a regular swell,&rdquo; said Clyde to his man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a young gentleman as is highly polished,
which these naval officers is generally,&rdquo; replied Jeems.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington directed the captain to call all
hands, and go through the evolutions of loosing and
furling, for the gratification of the guests of the ship.
Captain Cumberland bowed and raised his cap again
as he retired, and the principal hoped that Clyde
would take a lesson in good manners from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you walk to the quarter-deck, Miss Blacklock,&rdquo;
said the captain, touching his cap to the young
lady, to whom he had been formally introduced by the
principal. &ldquo;We are going to loose and furl, and you
can see better there than here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied Miss Celia. &ldquo;But what
did you say you were going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loose and furl the sails,&rdquo; replied the captain, as
he conducted the fair miss to the quarter-deck, where
they were followed by Mr. Lowington and the rest of
the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Judson,&rdquo; said the commander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; replied the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call all hands to loose and furl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands, sir,&rdquo; responded Judson, touching his
cap to his superior, as all on board were required
to do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
&ldquo;They are all swells,&rdquo; said Clyde to his man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands, loose sails!&rdquo; shouted the boatswain, as
he blew the proper blast on his whistle.</p>

<p>In a few moments every officer and seaman was
at his station for the man&oelig;uvre indicated by the call.
The students, aware that they were simply to &ldquo;show
off,&rdquo; were fully determined to astonish the wondering
crowd on the decks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by to lay aloft, the ready-men!&rdquo; shouted
the first lieutenant, as he received the order from the
captain.</p>

<p>It was repeated by the second lieutenant on the
forecastle, the third in the waist, and the fourth on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, sir!&rdquo; reported the several officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay aloft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the command those whose duty it was to prepare
the sails and rigging for the man&oelig;uvre sprang
up the rigging, and in three minutes the midshipman
aloft reported that all was ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay aloft, sail-loosers!&rdquo; continued the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>The seamen, who were arranged in proper order on
deck, the royal yard men first, then those who belonged
on the top-gallant yards, the topsail, and the
lower yards, placed in succession, so that each could
reach his station without passing others, leaped into
the rigging, and went up like so many cats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the boom tricing-lines!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are ropes by which the studding-sail booms,
which lie on the yards, are hauled up out of the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trice up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
The studding-sail booms were drawn up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay out! Loose sails!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hands jumped upon the foot-ropes, and worked
themselves out to their places on the yards, where
they loosed the sails, overhauled the rigging, and made
everything ready for the final evolution. The midshipman
in the tops reported to the officers on deck
when the preparations were completed, and the lieutenants
on deck, in their turn, reported to the first
lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let fall!&rdquo; said the executive officer; and all, as
one, the sails dropped from the yards.</p>

<p>The precision of the movement called forth a
demonstration of applause from the visitors. Mr.
Clyde Blacklock stood with his mouth open, looking
up at the students on the yards, but occasionally
glancing at the &ldquo;swellish&rdquo; first lieutenant, who seemed
to be the master-spirit of the occasion, because he
spoke in a loud voice, while the captain, who really
controlled the evolutions, could hardly be heard, except
by the executive officer, to whom alone his order
was given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay in! Lay down from aloft!&rdquo; said the first
lieutenant; and in a moment more all hands were on
deck again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever man the yards, sir?&rdquo; asked a gentleman
of the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Occasionally, sir&mdash;not often. You are aware that
it requires some preparation, for we are obliged to
extend life-lines over the yards,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowington.
&ldquo;We are not in condition to do it now. If we
should happen to be visited by the king at Copenhagen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
or Stockholm, and had previous notice, we
should certainly do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew were then required to go through the
man&oelig;uvre of furling sails, which was performed with
the same precision as the first evolution, and to the
great satisfaction of the guests, who were then invited
to visit the cabins and steerage of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I like this thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyde Blacklock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all very, <em>very</em> fine, Clyde,&rdquo; replied the tender
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the ship&#8217;s going up the Baltic, and then up
the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Clyde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I want to go in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Clyde!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And be a sailor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always told you I wanted to be a sailor. Didn&#8217;t
that head master, or whatever he is, say it would do
me good to go to sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did, but I can&#8217;t go with you, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want you to go with me. I&#8217;m not a
baby!&rdquo; protested the indignant youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are my only son, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had forty only sons, it would be all the
same to me. I say I want to go in this ship, and be
a sailor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blacklock was appalled, and was sorely disturbed
by the announcement of her son. The young
gentleman insisted that he should be entered at once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
as a member of the ship&#8217;s company. He suggested
to his anxious mother that she could travel by land
while he went by sea, and that she could see him
every time the ship went into port. The lady appeared
to see no alternative, but evidently felt compelled
to yield to her son&#8217;s demand. It was plain
enough, even to a casual observer, that Clyde was
the head of the family. Mrs. Blacklock promised to
speak to the principal, but she hoped he would not be
able to take her son. Before she had an opportunity
to make the application, the Orlando&#8217;s bell rang for
her passengers to return. The sound seemed to be a
relief to the lady; but Mr. Clyde put his foot down just
there, and upset all her hopes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Clyde; the Orlando is ready to go,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; replied the hopeful son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must go on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go. I&#8217;m off to sea in this ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, my dear,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Blacklock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&#8217;s the time. If you don&#8217;t speak to that head
master yourself, I shall do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, my dearest boy. This ship is going to
Christiania, and we will speak to the gentleman on the
subject when she arrives. Come, Clyde; the boat is
waiting for us, and all the other passengers have
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&#8217;t fool me, mother. I&#8217;m going to sea
now. I like this ship, and I rather like those swells
of officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde positively refused to leave the ship, though
his mother, almost in tears, begged him to accompany
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
&ldquo;My son won&#8217;t go with me,&rdquo; said she, as Mr. Lowington
came towards her to ascertain the cause of
their delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you desire, madam, the boatswain will put him
into the boat for you,&rdquo; replied the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me into the boat!&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant
youth. &ldquo;I should be glad to see him do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you? Peaks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On deck, sir,&rdquo; replied the big boatswain, touching
his cap to the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&#8217;t, sir&mdash;don&#8217;t!&rdquo; begged the lady. &ldquo;Clyde
wants to go to sea in your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, does he, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the principal.
&ldquo;We have a vacant place, and he can be accommodated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fond mother&#8217;s heart sank at this announcement.
Mr. Lowington, though his experience with
students of this description had been far from satisfactory,
felt that his duty to humanity required him to
take this boy, who was evidently on the high road to
ruin through the weak indulgence of his mother.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>A DAY AT CHRISTIANSAND.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;But, madam, your steamer seems to be on the
point of starting,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Lowington,
as the Orlando rang her bell, and whistled violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; replied the lady, apparently taking
no notice of the steamer. &ldquo;I came over here on
a pleasure excursion, and now I feel as though I had
lost my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost him, madam! We intend to save him,&rdquo;
laughed Mr. Lowington. &ldquo;But we have no claim upon
him. If you desire to leave in the steamer, the boatswain
shall put the boy on board whether he is willing
or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; that would be very, <em>very</em> harsh. Let the
steamer go. This matter is of vastly more consequence
than going to Christiania. James,&rdquo; she added,
turning to the man in livery, &ldquo;you will take the boat,
get our baggage from the steamer, and take it to the
hotel on shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mem,&rdquo; replied James, as he very deliberately
went over the side into the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be a sad day to me, sir,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Blacklock, as she glanced at her son, who was whistling
an air from the last opera, as indifferent as though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
his mother had been at peace in her own drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to repeat, madam, that I have not the slightest
wish to take your son into this institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Clyde insists upon joining the ship, and what
can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can say no, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better not say it, mother; if you do, I
will run away, and go to sea in a merchant ship,&rdquo;
added Clyde, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear, sir, what he says,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Blacklock,
with a long and deep sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be the very best thing in the world for
a boy troubled with his complaint,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no complaint; I&#8217;m not sick,&rdquo; growled
Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid you are, my boy, though you don&#8217;t know
it. The most dangerous maladies often make great
progress even before their existence is suspected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing ails me,&rdquo; added Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seems to be a very nice ship, and you say the
students are all gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the lady, glancing
around her at the ship and the crew. &ldquo;If Clyde
must go to sea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, mother,&rdquo; interposed the young gentleman,
very decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he must go to sea, he had better go with you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will walk into the cabin, madam, I will
show you our regulations,&rdquo; said the principal, leading
the way down the steps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Clyde followed, apparently unwilling that a word
should be said which he could not hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak with your mother alone,&rdquo; interposed
Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going too,&rdquo; persisted Clyde, after Mrs. Blacklock
had descended the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to see your mother alone,&rdquo; added the
principal, firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to talk about me, and I want to hear
what is said,&rdquo; replied the youth, rudely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peaks, remain here,&rdquo; said the principal to the big
boatswain, who had followed them to the companionway.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington descended the steps, and Peaks
slipped in behind him, fully understanding his duty
without any explanations. Clyde attempted to follow,
but the entrance was effectually blockaded by the stalwart
forward officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way; I want to go down there,&rdquo;
said Clyde, in no gentle tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&#8217;t be done, my hearty,&rdquo; replied Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going down, any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, my little gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am! Get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ease off, my hearty. Don&#8217;t get up a squall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see my mother,&rdquo; growled Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not invited to the cabin, and your mother
was,&rdquo; answered Peaks, very mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care if I wasn&#8217;t; I&#8217;m going down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you said before;&rdquo; and the boatswain tried to
pacify the youngster, and to induce him to be reasonable;
but Clyde had always had his own way, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
was ready to fight for it now, even though he had
nothing to gain by it.</p>

<p>Captain Cumberland was still walking with Miss
Celia, explaining to her the nature of the discipline on
board, and giving her an account of the voyage across
the Atlantic. A group of the officers had collected
on the quarter-deck, and, much amused at the scene,
were observing the conduct of Clyde. As he became
more violent, his sister tried to quiet him, and induce
him to behave like a gentleman; but he replied to her
in a tone and with words which made the captain&#8217;s
cheeks tinge with indignation.</p>

<p>Finally, when he found that abuse had no effect
upon the stout boatswain, he drew back, and made a
desperate plunge at his heavy opponent. Peaks caught
him by the shoulders, and lifted him off his feet like a
baby. Taking him in his arms, with one hand over
his mouth, to smother his cries, he bore him to the
waist, where his yells could not be heard by his
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, little one,&rdquo; said Peaks, as he seated himself
on the main-hatch, and twined his long legs
around those of the prisoner, so that he was held as
fast as though he had been in the folds of an anaconda.
&ldquo;Hold still, now, and I&#8217;ll spin you a sea-yarn. Once
on a time there was a little boy that wanted to go to
sea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go, or I&#8217;ll kill you!&rdquo; sputtered Clyde; but
the boatswain covered his mouth again, and silenced
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill me! That would be wicked. But I&#8217;m not
a mosquito, to be cracked in the fingers of such a dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
little boy as you are. But you snapped off my yarn;
and if you don&#8217;t hold still, I can&#8217;t spin it ship-shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde had well nigh exhausted his breath in his
fruitless struggle, and before his sister went far enough
forward to see him, he was tolerably calm, because he
had no more strength to resist. Then the boatswain
told his story of a boy that wanted to go to sea, but
found that he could not have his own way on board
the ship.</p>

<p>In the cabin, Mrs. Blacklock told a pitiful story of
the wilfulness of her son; that she was obliged to do
just as he said, and if he wanted anything, however
absurd it might be, she was obliged to give it to him,
or he made the house too &ldquo;hot&rdquo; for her. Her husband
had died when the children were small, and the
whole care of them had devolved on her. Clyde had
made her miserable for several years. She had sent
him to several celebrated schools; but he had got into
trouble immediately, and she had been compelled to
take him away, to prevent him from killing himself
and her, as she expressed it. Her husband had left
her a handsome property, but she was afraid her son
would spend it all, or compel her to do so, before he
became of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington repeated only what most of her
friends had told her before&mdash;that her weak indulgence
would be the ruin of the boy; that he needed a strong
arm. He was willing to take him into the Academy
ship, but he must obey all the rules and follow all the
regulations. The perplexed mother realized the truth
of all he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take him as an officer&mdash;won&#8217;t you, sir?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
she asked, when she had in a measure reconciled herself
to the discipline proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, madam,&rdquo; replied the principal.
&ldquo;If he ever becomes an officer, he must work himself
up to that position, as the other students do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you could let him have one of the rooms in
the cabin. I am willing to pay extra for his tuition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam; he must go with the other students,
and do precisely as they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will his servant lodge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, James. He will want a servant, for I don&#8217;t
know that he ever dressed himself alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can have no servant, except those of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s very, <em>very</em> hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is, but if the boy can&#8217;t dress himself
alone, he must lie in his berth till he acquires the art
by hard thinking. I wish you to understand the matter
thoroughly before you leave him, madam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blacklock struggled with the hard terms; but
even to her the case seemed like a desperate one, and
she was willing at last to try the experiment, though
she intended to follow the ship wherever she went, to
save him from suicide when his situation became absolutely
hopeless. The terms arranged, she followed
Mr. Lowington on deck, where Clyde was discovered
in the loving embrace of the big boatswain, who released
him as soon as he saw the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Clyde, my dear, we have arranged it all,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Blacklock; and it ought to be added that such
a result would have been utterly impossible if the subject
of the negotiations had been present.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care if you have,&rdquo; replied Clyde, bestowing
a fiery glance upon the boatswain, who was smiling
as blandly as though earth had no naughty boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, Clyde!&rdquo; demanded the
anxious mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve had enough of this ship,&rdquo; howled the little
gentleman, as he glanced again at the stout forward
officer.</p>

<p>The complacent face of Peaks maddened him,
and Clyde felt that, perhaps for the first time in his
life, he had lost a battle. He could not bear the sight
of the boatswain&#8217;s placid features, unruffled by anything
like anger or malice. He felt that he had not
even provoked his powerful adversary. He howled in
his anger, and then he cried in his desperation. Suddenly
he seized a wooden belaying-pin from the rail,
and shied it at the boatswain&#8217;s head. Peaks caught
it in his hand, as though he had been playing toss-ball
with his victim; but the next instant his anaconda fold
encircled the youth again. Mrs. Blacklock screamed
with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no harm done, madam,&rdquo; interposed the
principal. &ldquo;We don&#8217;t allow boys to throw things
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very, <em>very</em> harsh with the poor boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the poor boy is very, very harsh with us. He
throws belaying-pins at our heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; but that&#8217;s an unpleasant way of
manifesting his regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve had enough of this ship! I won&#8217;t go in her!&rdquo;
howled Clyde, struggling to escape from the grasp of
the officer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you hear that, sir? Poor boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will soon learn better than to behave in this
violent manner. We can cure him in ten minutes after
you have left the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! whip him?&rdquo; exclaimed the mother, with
horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam; we never strike a student under any
circumstances, unless it be in self-defence; but if a
boy won&#8217;t go when ordered, we carry him. We always
have force enough to do this without injury to
the person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see the poor boy struggle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do him no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says now that he will not go in the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were his parent, it would be as I said, not as
he said, after he had ceased to be reasonable. I would
consult the wishes and opinions of a boy of mine, as
long as he behaved properly&mdash;no longer. You have
only to leave him, and I assure you he shall be treated
as kindly as he will permit us to treat him. I do not
wish to influence you, but I am confident that ruin lies
in that boy&#8217;s path, unless he is reformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blacklock actually wept. She loved the boy
with a blind affection in spite of the disrespect and
even abuse that he heaped upon her. It was a terrible
struggle to her, but she finally decided to leave
him on board of the ship, perhaps satisfied that nothing
else could ever save him from himself, and her
from the misery his reckless conduct constantly occasioned
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wished to go to sea, Clyde, and I have decided
to leave you in this ship,&rdquo; said the poor mother,
trembling with emotion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I tell you I won&#8217;t stay in this ship,&rdquo; roared
Clyde, as Peaks, at a signal from the principal, released
his prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing with you, my dear boy. You
won&#8217;t obey me, and I must leave you to those who can
control you. I am going on shore now, but I shall
see you again at Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t stay!&rdquo; howled Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good by, Clyde,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blacklock, desperately,
as she folded her son in her arms, and kissed him
on both cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I won&#8217;t stay!&rdquo; cried the angry youth,
breaking away from his mother&#8217;s embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it short, madam,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do try to be good, Clyde, and then you can come
home very, <em>very</em> soon,&rdquo; added Mrs. Blacklock, as the
principal conducted her to the accommodation ladder,
where the first cutter had been manned to put her on
shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you again, I won&#8217;t stay! If you leave me,
I&#8217;ll jump overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; groaned the weak mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do, young man, we will pick you up with
the greatest pleasure,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington, as he hurried
the lady to the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, if he should!&rdquo; gasped she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not a particle of danger, madam; Mr.
Peaks will take excellent care of him,&rdquo; replied her
comforter.</p>

<p>The boatswain, at a nod from Mr. Lowington,
again embraced Clyde, but did not injure him, nor permit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
him to injure himself. The lady was handed into
the boat, and Captain Cumberland politely performed
this service for Miss Blacklock. Of course the poor
mother was in an agony of doubt and anxiety, but the
students in the cutter seemed to be so cheerful, contented
and gentlemanly, that she hoped for the best.</p>

<p>Clyde was appalled at the situation, and one of the
stern realities of life seemed suddenly to dawn upon
him. As soon as his mother disappeared over the
side, he ceased to struggle, for he gained nothing by
it, and the students appeared to be amused by his sufferings.
Peaks released him, and the victim of wholesome
discipline looked about him with a wondering
stare; but there was no mother to cajole or intimidate,
and he was thrown entirely upon his own resources
for the means of resistance, if he purposed to resist.
He appeared to be stupefied by the situation, and Mr.
Lowington, taking advantage of his bewilderment,
invited him into the main cabin, where he kindly but
firmly &ldquo;laid down the law&rdquo; to him. Clyde was by
no means conquered, but was rather considering how
he should escape from this trying position. At the
close of the interview, the principal handed the patient
over to one of the stewards, and requested him to see
the new comer clothed in the uniform of the ship.
Peaks was directed to keep an eye on the victim while
the crew were on shore.</p>

<p>All hands were soon seated in the boats, and in half
an hour all the students in the squadron were turned
loose in the streets of Christiansand. Though the instructors
were of the party, they were not required to
exercise any particular supervision over their pupils.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
There was hardly anything to be seen, and as a large
number of the students had never crossed the Atlantic
before, they wanted to know if they had come so far
to see such a town. Most of the houses were of wood,
but they were neat and well kept. As the capital of
the province of Christiansand, the town was the residence
of the Stift Amtmand, or governor, and of the
bishop of the diocese. It was founded in 1641, and
having an excellent harbor, it is a place of considerable
commercial importance, having a population of
about ten thousand.</p>

<p>The boys visited the cathedral, which is a fine
building of gray stone, and being the first which most
of them had seen, it had a considerable interest to
them. They observed the people, and their manners
and customs, so far as they could, with more interest
than the buildings, which differed in no important
respect from those in the United States. Passing
across the water front of the town, they came to the
Torrisdal River, over which there is an excellent
bridge. They crossed the stream, and walked to an
antiquated church. Some of the houses on the way
were very neat, pretty structures, not unlike the one-story
dwellings seen all over New England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a Runic stone,&rdquo; said Dr. Winstock, as the
captain and several of the officers followed him into
the burying-ground connected with the ancient church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a Runic stone?&rdquo; asked Lincoln, the third
lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stone with Runic characters upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t the least idea what the word means,
though Poe sings, in the &lsquo;Bells,&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
 &lsquo;Keeping time, time, time,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .4em;">In a sort of Runic rhyme!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>Runic is derived from a word which means secret;
and a Runic stone is any memorial, table, or column,
on which Runic characters are inscribed, as a tombstone,
a boundary mark. There are sixteen of these
characters, forming an alphabet, which were used by
the ancient Scandinavians, and were thought by them
to possess magical properties, and willow wands inscribed
with them were used by the pagans of the north
in their magic rites. Sticks were used as almanacs, to
keep the account of the days and months, and also
constituted the day-books and ledgers of the ancients.
In Germany, in modern times, the baker, for example,
and the purchaser of bread, each had a stick, and
the number of loaves delivered was notched upon
both. Scarcely less primitive was the custom of some
of our American farmers, who kept their accounts on
the barn door; and I have heard a story of one who,
when required to produce his books in court at a
lawsuit, carried in the barn door, and held it up before
the judge and jury. In Denmark and Sweden you will
see more Runic writings, especially in the museum at
Copenhagen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to bury people here, in about the same
manner as with us,&rdquo; said Captain Cumberland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not half so much difference between
things here and those at home as I expected to find,&rdquo;
added Judson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The houses are almost the same, and so are the
people,&rdquo; continued Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People coming to Europe are often disappointed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
because they find almost everything so near like what
they have been accustomed to,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
&ldquo;You will find Norway and Sweden more like New
England than any other countries on the continent.
But I think you will find differences enough to excite
your interest and attention before you return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students walked back to Christiansand, and
having exhausted the town, went on board the vessels
of the squadron, ready and even anxious to continue
the voyage. The pilots were on deck, Paul Kendall
and lady had returned to the Grace, and the principal
only waited the arrival of the steamer Moss, from
Frederiksv&aelig;rn, to give the order to get under way.
The boats were all hoisted up except the first cutter,
which was to bring off the unfortunate crew of the
professor&#8217;s barge, as soon as they arrived.</p>

<p>At eight o&#8217;clock the steamer came in, and the first
cutter, with the principal on board, hastened to her
landing-place, to meet Sanford and his companions.
To his great astonishment and regret, they were not on
board of the Moss. The captain, who spoke English
very well, knew nothing about the absentees, and was
quite confident they were not on board of the Foldin,
the boat which had picked them up. Captain Hoell
had said nothing to him about the accident, but then
the Foldin had arrived only that morning, instead of
the night before, when she was due, and their interview
had been very hurried. &ldquo;Did any person in the
Moss know anything about the unfortunates?&rdquo; the
captain was kind enough to inquire; and a passenger
was found who heard some one say that a party of
young men had been landed by the Foldin at Lillesand.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
But the Moss had left Lillesand at six o&#8217;clock,
and her captain had not seen or heard of the persons
described. Mr. Lowington was very anxious about
the fate of the second cutter&#8217;s crew, and feared that
some of them had been injured by the collision, so
that they were unable to take the steamer back to
Christiansand. He returned to the cutter and pulled
off to the Tritonia, and directed Mr. Tompion, the
second vice-principal, in charge of her, to run into
Lillesand, and ascertain what had become of the
absentees. Without waiting for the signal, the Tritonia
got under way, and under full sail, with a fresh
breeze, stood out of the harbor. The other vessels
followed her soon after, the principal intending to lay
off and on till the Tritonia reported.</p>

<p>The ship had been searched from keel to truck for
Ole Amundsen on the day before. Of course he was
not found, and the conclusion was that he had dropped
into the water and swam ashore, though it was difficult
to understand how he had accomplished the feat
without detection. Inquiries in regard to him were
made on shore, but if any one knew him, application
was not made to the right persons.</p>

<p>Mr. Clyde Blacklock had not yet jumped overboard,
and during the busy scene of getting under way, he
stood with his mouth agape, watching the proceedings
with wondering interest. He was not quite sure, after
his anger had subsided, that he had made a bad bargain.
There was something rather pleasant in the
motion of the ship, and the zeal and precision with
which the students worked, showed that they enjoyed
their occupation. No one noticed Clyde, or even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
seemed to be aware of his presence. Before, when
he behaved in an extravagant and unreasonable manner,
the boys only laughed at him. They did not beg
him to be pacified, as his mother and James always
did; on the contrary they seemed to enjoy his chagrin.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was under way, the new student
was informed that he belonged to the port watch,
second part, and the silver star, which designated his
watch, was affixed to his left arm. He was told that
he would be called with the others to take his turn on
deck during the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he asked, rather blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same as the others do?&rdquo; replied De Forrest,
the fourth lieutenant, who had the deck with the
second part of the port watch. &ldquo;I have your station
bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a card on which all your duties are explained.
Here it is,&rdquo; added De Forrest, producing the station
bill. &ldquo;You are No. 71; all the even numbers belong
to the starboard watch, and all the odd numbers to
the port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cards were all printed; for among the various
amusements provided for the students, a couple
of octavo Novelty presses, with a sufficient supply of
type and other printing material had been furnished.
All the blanks for use in the ship were printed on
board, and the Oceanic Enterprise, a weekly Journal,
had been regularly issued during the voyage across
the Atlantic, though a gale of wind, which disturbed
the equilibrium of the press and the printers, had
delayed its publication a couple of days on one occasion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Clyde read the station bill which was handed to him
by the officer, but it would have been just as intelligible
to him if it had been in Runic character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reefing, main-topsail, and main-topsail halyards,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Clyde, reading from the card. &ldquo;What
does all that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mind only what you have to do yourself, and
not trouble your head about orders that have nothing
to do with your work; for the orders come as thick as
snow flakes at Christmas. When all hands are called
to reef topsails, you are one of them, of course. When
any thing is said about topsails, or topsail-halyards,
you are the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good; I understand that, and I shall make a
sailor, I know,&rdquo; added Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will. The order will come to &lsquo;settle
away the topsail halyards.&rsquo; Be ready to help then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&#8217;t know the topsail halyards from a pint
of soup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; added the lieutenant, conducting
his pupil to the rail, and pointing out the main-topsail
halyards. &ldquo;Then, when the officer says, &lsquo;Aloft, top-men,&rsquo;
you will run up the main rigging here, and the
midshipman in the top will tell you what to do. At
the word, you will lay out on the yard, and do as the
others do. At the words, &lsquo;Lay down from aloft,&rsquo;
you will come on deck, and hoist up the main-topsail.
Nearly all your duty is connected with the main-topsail.
In tacking, you will go to the clew-garnets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These ropes, by which the corners of the mainsail
are hauled up,&rdquo; answered De Forrest, pointing out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
clew-garnets. &ldquo;You will also let go the main tack.
In getting under way, you will help loose the main-topsail.
In anchoring, you are at the main clew-lines,
and the main brace. Here they are. In loosing and
furling you are on the main-topsail. In boat service,
you are attached to the third cutter. You sleep in
berth No. 71, your ship&#8217;s number, and eat with mess
No. 6.&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Forrest, as instructed by the principal, carefully
explained the duties of the new comer, indicating
every rope as he mentioned it, and describing its use.
He was prudent in his manner, and tried to give the
proud youth no offence by making him feel the superiority
of an officer. The lieutenant then conducted
him to his mess room, and pointed out his berth.</p>

<p>The wind was still from the southward, and quite
fresh; and though the squadron went under short sail,
it was off Lillesand in a couple of hours. The Tritonia,
which was a fast vessel, did not detain her consorts
more than a couple of hours. Mr. Tompion
boarded the ship, and reported that the crew of the
second cutter had landed at Lillesand, and fearing that
they should miss the ship if they returned to Christiansand,
had taken carioles, and left early in the morning
for Christiania. There were ten of the party, and
one of them was a Norwegian, though he was dressed
like the others. Mr. Lowington could not imagine
who the Norwegian was that wore the Academy&#8217;s
uniform, for it did not occur to him that Ole could
have joined them. He was glad to hear that all of
them were well, and able to travel; and had no doubt
they would arrive in safety at Christiania. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
aware that the crew of the second cutter were rather
wild boys; but as there were no large towns in the
interior, he had no fear that they would be led astray
among the simple Norwegians.</p>

<p>The fleet filled away again, and at eight bells the
following morning was off Frederiksv&aelig;rn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>UP THE CHRISTIANIA FJORD.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;I should like to know where this place is,&rdquo;
said Ryder, the second master, as he appeared
upon the quarter-deck of the ship, with one of the
forty bound volumes of Harper&#8217;s Magazine, which
were contained in the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What place?&rdquo; asked Lincoln, the third lieutenant,
as he glanced at the volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s more than I know; but here is a picture of
a steamer between two high bluffs of rock, and under
it, she is said to be entering the fjord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are just at the mouth of the fjord now, and
if there are any such rocks as those here, I should like
to see them. Why, you see they rise above the
steamer&#8217;s main-topmast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lincoln took the book, and read the description;
but he was none the wiser for his labor, for the narrow
strait through which the steamer in the picture
was passing was not particularly described. The
book was shown to the pilot, who did not know just
where the place was; but after he had been told that
the steamer came from Gottenburg, and was on her
way to Christiania, he thought that the bold rocks
must be in the vicinity of Frederiksv&aelig;rn. He offered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to take the ship through the pass, as the wind was
fair, and Mr. Lowington consented that he should do
so, for in order to enable the students to see the fine
scenery on the fjord, the studies were to be laid aside
for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see where there can be anything like this,&rdquo;
said Ryder, as he surveyed the shores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of islands here, but certainly
none of them rise to any such heights as those in the
picture,&rdquo; replied Lincoln. &ldquo;They are bare rocks out
at sea, but some of them are a little green farther in.
It don&#8217;t begin to be so wild as I supposed it was in
these parts. Why, I have read and heard so much
about the Christiania Fjord, that I supposed it was the
grandest scenery in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&#8217;t look much like the picture&mdash;does it?&rdquo;
laughed Ryder.</p>

<p>In a short time the ship was approaching the narrow
pass. The cliffs on each side were very bold
and rugged, and if the students had not been feasting
themselves with grand anticipations, they would have
appreciated the scenery much better. Ryder and
Lincoln laughed when they compared the reality
with the pictures they had. The scenery could not
be called grand, though it was certainly very fine.
The strait was very narrow, and on each side of it
rings were fastened in the rocks, which were painted
white around them, for the convenience of vessels
warping out in a calm or against the wind. On the
high rock,&mdash;it could not have been a hundred feet
high,&mdash;at the right, was a small fort, which looked
grim and terrible in its way, but which any well-ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
man of war, with modern ordnance, could
have battered down in half an hour.</p>

<p>Passing through the strait, the ship came in sight of
the small village of Frederiksv&aelig;rn, which is a naval
station, where a number of gunboats are housed in a
series of uniform buildings. The town itself is only
a hamlet, but as the vessels proceeded, those on board
saw Laurvig at the head of the bay, which is a place
of considerable importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little F&oelig;rder,&rdquo; said the pilot, an hour later, as he
pointed to a tall, red light-house, at the entrance of
the fjord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the land we see beyond must be Sweden,&rdquo;
added Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sverige</em>,&rdquo; nodded the pilot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is Sweden, but I don&#8217;t see the use
of having half a dozen names to a country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is <em>Norge</em>,&rdquo; added the second master,
pointing to the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>Norge</em>,&rdquo; answered the pilot, pleased to hear
the young officer apply the Norwegian name.</p>

<p>On the port hand of the ship was a vast sea of
rocky islands, of all shapes and sizes. Those farthest
from the mainland were entirely destitute of soil or
verdure; but in the distance a few pines, and the fresh
tints of the early grass, could be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her north-north-east,&rdquo; said the pilot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the weather and stand by the lee braces!&rdquo;
shouted the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>Clyde Blacklock took out his station card, and
looked to see whether the order applied to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are on the main brace,&rdquo; said Scott, a good-natured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
young tar, who happened to be near the new
student. &ldquo;There you are, on the weather side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spoke to you?&rdquo; demanded Clyde, dropping
his card, and looking Scott in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t been introduced to you, I know; but I
thought you wanted to know your duty,&rdquo; laughed
Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take care of yourself, and I&#8217;ll mind my own
duty,&rdquo; growled Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my lad,&rdquo; replied the good-natured student,
whose station was at the weather fore brace.</p>

<p>Clyde walked aft, and placed himself in the line
of those who were to haul on the weather main
brace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slack the lee, and haul on the weather braces,&rdquo;
said the first lieutenant, and the other officers repeated
the order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk away with it!&rdquo; shouted the fourth lieutenant
to those at the main brace.</p>

<p>Clyde took hold, and tugged with all his might;
but the brace would not come away. To tell the
exact truth, there was a disposition among the students
to haze the new comer, and the main brace men
had agreed among themselves to let him do the whole
of the work. They pretended to haul, but not one of
them bore a pound upon the brace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull!&rdquo; shouted Clyde, at the top of his lungs,
as he strained at the rope. &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you pull,
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence on the quarter-deck!&rdquo; cried the executive
officer&mdash;for all work was required to be performed in
silence. &ldquo;Walk away with the main brace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, boys, why don&#8217;t you pull?&rdquo; roared Clyde,
who was blest with a pair of hearty lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, Blacklock! You mustn&#8217;t hollo like that
when you are on duty,&rdquo; interposed De Forrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says I mustn&#8217;t?&rdquo; demanded Clyde, dropping
his hold upon the brace, and walking up to the officer
who had dared to give him these words of counsel,
which were uttered in a mild and pleading tone, rather
than in those of authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starboard the helm,&rdquo; said the executive officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starboard, sir,&rdquo; repeated the quartermaster at the
wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk away with that main brace!&rdquo; added the
first lieutenant.</p>

<p>The main brace men, finding that Clyde was at
issue with the fourth lieutenant, applied themselves to
their work, and the main yard swung round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; said the executive officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast hauling! Belay, all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By these man&oelig;uvres the ship had been kept away,
and was now headed directly up the fjord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t allow any fellow to speak to me like that,&rdquo;
blustered Clyde. &ldquo;I want you to understand that I
am a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go forward, Blacklock, and don&#8217;t make a row
on the quarter-deck,&rdquo; replied De Forrest, mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll not go forward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must report you to the first lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m willing to do my work, but I won&#8217;t be fagged
by any nob in gold lace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are making a mistake, Blacklock,&rdquo; said De
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Forrest, in a low tone, as he walked towards the angry
Briton, with the intention of reasoning with him upon
the absurdity of his conduct.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington had cautioned him and other officers
to be very prudent in dealing with the new student till
he had become accustomed to his duty, and certainly
De Forrest was prudent in the extreme. Perhaps
Clyde misunderstood the purpose of this officer when
approaching him, and suspected that he intended to
use violence, for, drawing back, he made a pass at De
Forrest with his fist. But the latter detected the nature
of the demonstration in season to ward off the
blow, and, still in the exercise of the extreme prudence
which had before characterized his conduct, retreated
to the other side of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of that,&rdquo; said Judson, the first lieutenant,
as he stepped between Clyde and De Forrest.</p>

<p>Clyde was very angry. Though he had made up
his mind to perform his duty in the beginning, he
fancied that no one had the right to command him to
be silent. In his wrath he pulled off his blue jacket,
tossed it upon the deck with a flourish, and intimated
that if the first lieutenant wanted to fight, he was
ready for him. Happily the first lieutenant did not
wish to fight, though he was fully prepared to defend
himself. At this crisis, the principal observed the
hostile attitude of the young Briton, and quietly ordered
Peaks to interfere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go forward, Blacklock,&rdquo; said Judson, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t go forward! I have been insulted, and
I&#8217;ll break the sconce of the fellow that did it,&rdquo; added
Clyde, glancing at the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, my hearty, let us go forward, as we are
ordered,&rdquo; interposed Peaks, as he picked up Clyde in
his arms, and in spite of his struggles, carried him
into the waist.</p>

<p>It was useless to resist the big boatswain, and the
pressure of Peaks&#8217;s arms soon crushed out Clyde&#8217;s anger,
and like a little child, he was set down upon the
deck, amid the laughter of his companions. He felt
that he was not getting ahead at all; and though he
reserved the expression of his anger, he determined at
the first convenient opportunity to thrash both Judson
and De Forrest. He had also decided to run away at
the first chance, even if he had to camp on a desolate
island in doing so. He regarded Peaks as a horrible
ogre, whose only mission in the ship was to persecute
and circumvent him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll have it out with those nobs yet,&rdquo; said Clyde,
as Peaks left him, restored to his senses, so far as outward
appearances were concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it out! Have what out?&rdquo; asked Scott, the
good-natured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll whip that nob who told me to be silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you do it, my jolly Briton,&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the first lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I do; and I&#8217;ll teach him better manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&#8217;t hurt him; Judson&#8217;s a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care if he is; he&#8217;ll catch it; and De Forrest,
too. They insulted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say they didn&#8217;t mean to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll give them a chance to apologize,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
added Clyde, a little mollified by the mild words
of his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s very kind of you; but officers don&#8217;t often
apologize to seamen for telling them of it when they
disobey the rules of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rules or not, I&#8217;ll hammer them both if they don&#8217;t
apologize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be cruel with them,&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that big boatswain&mdash;I&#8217;ll be even with
him yet,&rdquo; blustered Clyde, as he shook his head
menacingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to thrash him too?&rdquo; asked Scott,
opening his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll take care of him. He don&#8217;t toss me round in
that way without suffering for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&#8217;t hurt him,&rdquo; suggested the good-natured
seaman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;ll get a broken head before he grows much
older,&rdquo; added Clyde, drawing out a belaying-pin from
the fife-rail. &ldquo;I shall not be in this ship a great while
longer; but I mean to stay long enough to settle my
accounts with the big boatswain and the two nobs on
the quarter-deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to do it, my dear Albion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me. No man can insult me without
suffering for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the officers will apologize, but I don&#8217;t believe
Peaks will. He&#8217;s an obstinate fellow, and would
do just what the principal told him to do, even if it
was to swallow you and me, and half a dozen other
fellows. You don&#8217;t mean to lick the principal too&mdash;do
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t had any trouble with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is at the bottom of it all. He told Peaks
to persecute you. I&#8217;m not sure that the principal isn&#8217;t
more to blame than all the others put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter for him; he has done very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to let him off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say I&#8217;ve nothing against the head master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be too hard on Peaks,&rdquo; added Scott, as he
climbed upon the rail to see the scenery of the fjord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose all these islands, points, bays, and channels
have names, just as they do on the other side of
the ocean,&rdquo; said Laybold, at whose side the good-natured
tar seated himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; nodded Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;how should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t know but you might have seen the chart,&rdquo;
added Scott, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a town!&rdquo; exclaimed the enthusiastic Laybold,
as the progress of the ship opened a channel,
at the head of which was a village, with a church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see; that&#8217;s Bossenboggenberg,&rdquo; said Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, is it? Is that a river?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. That&#8217;s only a channel, called the Hoppenboggen,
which extends around the Island of Toppenboggen.
That channel is navigable for small vessels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn all those names?&rdquo; demanded
Laybold, amazed at the astonishing words which his
companion rolled off so glibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father had to send me to sea to keep me from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
learning too much. My hair all fell off, and the
schoolmasters were afraid of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s another town ahead on the port hand,&rdquo;
said Laybold, a little later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Aggerhousenboggen, I think. Let me
see; here&#8217;s Cape Tingumboggen, and that must be the
opening to the Stoppenboggen Fjord. Yes, that must
be Aggerhousenboggen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to pronounce Norwegian so
well, Scott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I learned Norwegian when I was an infant. I
could speak it first rate before I learned to utter my
mother tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go &#8217;way!&rdquo; protested Laybold. &ldquo;Do you know
what island that is on the starboard hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do. Do you think my education has
been neglected to that extent? That&#8217;s Steppenfetchenboggen.
A very fine island it is, too,&rdquo; continued
Scott, rattling off the long names so that they had a
decidedly foreign ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see how you can pronounce those words,&rdquo;
added Laybold. &ldquo;They would choke me to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe they would,&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>The squadron passed through several narrow passages,
and then came to a broad expanse of water at
the mouth of the Drammen River. The students
were perched on the rail and in the rigging of the
various vessels, observing with great interest the development
of the panorama, which seemed to be unrolled
before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather fine scenery,&rdquo; said Lincoln, who still
carried the book in his hand, and occasionally glanced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
at the pictures; &ldquo;but I think the artist here must have
multiplied the height of the cliffs by two, and divided
the height of houses, men, and masts by the same
number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like an exaggeration,&rdquo; replied
Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; added Lincoln, pointing to a scene
on the coast of Norway. &ldquo;There&#8217;s a large steamer carrying
a top-gallant yard on the foremast. That mast
is probably a hundred and fifty feet high, and there
are hills and bluffs beyond it&mdash;which would lose by
the perspective&mdash;five times as high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still it is very fine scenery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is; but no finer than we have on the coast of
Maine. You remember last summer we went through
the Reach, down by Machias? That was something
like this, and quite as pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mustn&#8217;t be too critical, Lincoln,&rdquo; laughed
Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t intend to be critical; but I had an idea,
from the pictures I have seen, that Christiania Fjord
was something like the Saguenay River, where the
cliffs rise perpendicularly four or five hundred feet
high. These pictures would certainly lead one to expect
such sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horton,&rdquo; said the pilot, pointing to a town which
now came into view, as the vessel passed beyond a
point of land.</p>

<p>It was a small place, in appearance not unlike a
New England village. At the wharf were a couple
of small steamers, one of which had come down the
Drammen, and the entire population of the town
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
seemed to have turned out on the occasion, for the
shore was covered with people. They were all neatly
dressed. On the opposite side of the fjord was the
town of Moss, where the convention by which Norway
and Sweden were united was drawn up and agreed
upon.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed rapidly before the fresh breeze
across the broad expanse, and then entered a narrow
passage. There was a gentle declivity on each side
of the fjord, which was covered, as far as the eye
could see, with pines. Dr&ouml;bak, on the right, is a village
of one street, on the side of the hill. The houses
are mostly of one story, painted yellow, with roofs
covered with red tile. Before noon the passage began
to widen, and the fleet entered another broad expanse
of water, filled with rocky islands, at the head of
which stood the city of Christiania. Some of the islets
were pretty and picturesque, in some instances having
a single cottage upon them, with a little garden.
The rocks were often of curious formation, and the
shore of one island was as regular and smooth as
though it had been a piece of masonry. After rounding
a point of rocks, the fleet came into full view of
Christiania. The city and its environs are spread out
on the southern slope of a series of hills, and presents
a beautiful landscape to the eye. On the left the country
was covered with villas, prominent among which
was Oscarshal, a summer palace of the late king.
On the right was the castle of Agershuus, rising abruptly
from the water. At a little distance from the town
was a kind of hotel, built on a picturesque island, with
its pretty landing-place, not unlike some similar establishments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
near the head of Narragansett Bay. At the
wharf in front of the city, and lying in the bay, was a
considerable number of steamers, some of them quite
large. The fleet ran up to the front of the city and
anchored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the end of my voyage,&rdquo; said Clyde Blacklock,
when everything had been put in order on board
of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going yet&mdash;are you?&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to stop, and whip Peaks
and the two lieutenants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough for that. I suppose the ship will
stay here two or three days&mdash;won&#8217;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a week. I suppose we shall go on shore
this afternoon, and see the sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Scott, if you tell those officers what I&#8217;ve
been saying to you, I&#8217;ll serve you in the same way,&rdquo;
added Clyde, as for the first time it occurred to him
that he had been imprudent in developing his plans
to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! You won&#8217;t lick me, too&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you behave like a man, and don&#8217;t peach,&rdquo;
answered Clyde, in a patronizing tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to be a good boy, then,&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only want to catch them on shore, where I can
have fair play. I&#8217;m not to be fagged by any fellow
that ever was born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde walked uneasily about the deck till the crew
were piped to dinner, evidently thinking how he should
carry his big intentions into execution. To one less
moved by fancied insults and indignities the case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
would have looked hopeless. He devoured his dinner
in a much shorter period than is usually allotted by
well-bred Englishmen to that pleasing diversion, and
hastened on deck again. Peaks was there, acting as
ship-keeper, while the carpenter was painting the
second cutter, the repairs upon which had been completed.
The big boatswain was seated on one of the
cat-heads, where he could see the entire deck of the
ship, and observe every craft that approached her.
The new student observed his position, and thought
he was seated in a very careless manner. A very
wicked thought took possession of the Briton&#8217;s mind,
and he ascended to the top-gallant forecastle. The
boatswain sat very composedly on the cat-head, with
his feet hanging over the water, and was just then
studying the beauties of the landscape. A very slight
exercise of force would displace him, and drop him
into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my hearty, you stowed your grub in a hurry,&rdquo;
said Peaks, when he discovered the new pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not very hungry, and thought I would take
another look at the town,&rdquo; replied Clyde. &ldquo;What&#8217;s
that big building off there, near the hills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be the county jail, the court-house, or
the lunatic asylum. I haven&#8217;t the least idea what it is,&rdquo;
answered Peaks, indifferently. &ldquo;The professors can
tell you all about those things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where that ship came from?&rdquo; added
Clyde, pointing to a vessel which was standing in
ahead of the Young America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&#8217;t a ship,&rdquo; replied Peaks, as he turned
partly round, so that he could see the craft. &ldquo;That&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
&#8217;mofferdite brig; or, as bookish people would say, an
hermaphrodite brig&mdash;half brig and half schooner.
You must call things, especially vessels, by their right
names, or you will fall in the opinion of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant the big boatswain dropped into the
deep waters of the fjord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will fall, in my opinion,&rdquo; said Clyde, as,
taking advantage of his antagonist&#8217;s attention to the
brig, he gave him a smart push, which displaced him
from the cat-head.</p>

<p>But Peaks, who was half man and half fish, was as
much at home in the water as on the deck, and struck
out for the cable, by which the ship was anchored, as
the nearest point of support. Clyde walked along
the rail till he came to the swinging-boom, where the
boats which had been lowered for use after dinner
were fastened. Climbing out on the boom, he dropped
down by the painter into the third cutter, one of the
four-oar boats. Bitts, the carpenter, who had been the
only person on board except the boatswain, was in the
waist busily at work upon the boat, and did not observe
that anything unusual had transpired. Clyde
had practised gymnastics a great deal, and was an active,
agile fellow. Casting off the painter of the third
cutter, he worked her astern, so as to avoid Peaks.
Then, shipping a pair of oars, he pulled for the shore.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the boatswain, disdaining to call
for assistance, and not having observed the movements
of Clyde, climbed up the cable to the hawse-hole, and
then, by the bowsprit guys, made his way to the top-gallant
forecastle, where he discovered the Briton in
the cutter, pulling with all his might for the shore.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Shaking the water from his clothes, he hastened to the
main cabin, and informed the principal that the new
scholar had left the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left the ship!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lowington. &ldquo;Were
you not on deck while the students were at dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, most of the time; but just at the moment
when the young sculpin left the ship, I happened to
be in the water,&rdquo; answered Peaks, shrugging his
shoulders like a Frenchman, and glancing at his wet
garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you in the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little Britisher pushed me overboard, when I
was sitting on the cat-head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; added the principal. &ldquo;We must get him
back before his mother arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time most of the students had come up from
the steerage, and the order was given to pipe away
the first cutter. Peaks was directed to change his
clothes, and go in her. He was ready by the time the
crew were in their seats, for, as he was not a fashionable
man, his toilet was soon made. The boats from
the other vessels of the fleet, including those of the
yachts, were already on their way to the town. The
first cutter pulled to the shore; but Clyde had already
landed, and disappeared in the city.</p>

<p>As at Christiansand, Paul Kendall and lady decided
to remain on shore during the stay of the fleet. They
had several pieces of baggage, and the custom-house
officers on the wharf were obliged to examine them,
after which they followed a porter to the Victoria
Hotel, which was said to be the best in the place.
Peaks found a man who could speak English, and immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
applied himself to the business of finding
the runaway. Clyde had been seen going up one of
the streets, but no one knew anything about him.</p>

<p>The fugitive felt that he had achieved a victory. He
had &ldquo;paid off&rdquo; the big boatswain, and no fellow on
board of the ship could believe that he had not kept
his word. He walked up the street till he came to
Dronningensgaden. People looked at him as though
he were a stranger, and he became aware that his uniform
was exciting attention. In the Kirkegade he
found a clothing store, in which the shop-keeper spoke
English. In changing his dress on board of the ship,
he had retained the contents of his pockets, including
a well-filled purse. He selected a suit of clothes
which pleased him, and immediately put it on. At
another store he bought a hat, and then he appeared
like a new being. With the bundle containing his uniform,
he walked till he found a carriage, in which he
seated himself, and ordered the driver to leave him at
the Victoria Hotel. He thought it would only be necessary
for him to keep out of sight till evening, when
his mother would probably arrive in the Foldin, and
he was confident he could induce her to withdraw him
from the Academy. He would stay in his room the
rest of the day, and by that time the search for him,
if any was made, would be ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a nice room for myself, another for my
mother and sister, who will arrive this evening, and a
place for the man,&rdquo; said Clyde, as the porter of the
hotel touched his cap, and helped him out of the carriage.</p>

<p>The young man was evidently a person of some importance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
The porter, the clerk, and the head waiter,
who came out to receive him, bowed low. A man
took his bundle, and he was ushered to a room on the
ground floor. As he crossed the court, he discovered
several of the Orlando&#8217;s passengers in the reading-room.
He had not entered his chamber before there
was another arrival,&mdash;Paul Kendall and lady,&mdash;who
were assigned to the next room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE SIGHTS OF CHRISTIANIA AND OTHER MATTERS.</strong></p>


<p>As there was in Christiania much to be seen that
needed explanation, the students were required
to keep together, and several guides from the hotel
were obtained, to conduct the party to the various
objects of interest in the city. A walk through some
of the principal streets brought them to the new Parliament
house, which is called the <em>Storthingsbyggningen</em>.
It is a fine building, but with nothing remarkable
about it. In the lower house, the students
seated themselves in the chairs of the members, and
Mr. Mapps took the speaker&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christiania was founded in 1624, on the site of
the ancient city of Osloe, which was destroyed by fire.
It is the residence of the king during his sojourn in
Norway, and the new palace, which you saw on the
hill, was completed for his use in 1848. The city, as
you have seen, is regularly laid out, and the buildings
are either of brick or stone. Formerly the dwellings
were of wood, but the frequent fires caused the adoption
of a law that no more wooden buildings should
be erected within the precincts of the city. The place
has considerable commerce, and now contains nearly
sixty thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
&ldquo;A street here is called a <em>gade</em>, and you observe
that the street and its name form one word, as Carl-Johansgade,
or Charles John Street; Kongensgade, or
King Street; Kirkegaden, or Church Street. The
same word is used in German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money of Norway is different from that of
Sweden or Denmark. The specie dollar, which is
generally called a &lsquo;specie,&rsquo; is the unit, and contains
five marks of twenty-four skillings each. A specie, or
<em>specie-daler</em>, as it is written, is worth about one dollar
and eight cents of our money. It is near enough for
our purpose to say that a mark is twenty-two cents, and
a skilling one cent. The coins in circulation are the
mark, the two, the four, and the twelve skilling piece.
Species and half species are coined, but paper money
is generally used for large sums, each denomination
being printed on a particular colored paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probable that the French system of weights
and measures will soon be introduced in Sweden and
Norway; but now a Norwegian <em>pund</em> is one and one
tenth pounds avoirdupois; a <em>fod</em> is twelve and two
hundredths inches; and a <em>kande</em> is three and three
tenths pints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mapps descended from the rostrum, and after
the party had looked at the chamber of the upper
house, and other apartments, they walked to the
king&#8217;s palace&mdash;the first royal dwelling which most
of the students ever saw. They passed through the
throne room, the court saloon, the dining room, and
other rooms, and some of them concluded that royalty
was not half so splendid as they had supposed. But
Norway is a poor country compared with many others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in Europe, and it is a pity that she ever thought it
necessary to spend a million and a half of dollars in a
weak attempt to imitate the grandeur of other realms.
There was nothing in the palace to astonish even our
young republicans, though the rooms of the queen,
on the first floor, were pretty and prettily furnished.
The building, which is a great, overgrown structure,
without symmetry or elegance, is in a beautiful situation,
and surrounded by pleasant grounds, well laid
out, from which a fine view of the city and fjord is
obtained.</p>

<p>Connected with the university are several museums
and cabinets, which are open to the public, and well
worth a visit, though they do not compare with those of
the great cities of Europe. The party walked through
all these rooms, one of which contained a small collection
of northern antiquities. From the university the
students went to a kind of garden, which is a weak
imitation of &ldquo;Tivoli,&rdquo; in Copenhagen, containing
promenades, concert room, a small opera house, and
a drinking saloon. The castle of Agershuus, on a hill
at the southern side of the city, was next visited. Its
guns command the harbor, and it is regarded as a
place of great strength, for it has successfully resisted
several sieges. Climbing a long flight of steps, the
party reached the ramparts, which are laid out in
walks, and are much resorted to by the citizens, as
they command a lovely view of the fjord and the surrounding
country. A portion of the castle is used as
a prison, and the convicts work in gangs about the
premises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was Robin Hood&#8217;s prison&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it, Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Mapps?&rdquo; asked Lincoln, who had an inquiring mind,
after he had enjoyed the prospect from the ramparts
for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied the instructor. &ldquo;H&ouml;yland,
sometimes called the Robin Hood, but, I think, more
properly the Baron Trenck, of Norway, was sentenced
to imprisonment for life in this castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; inquired Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For robbery and other crimes. Like Robin Hood
and Mike Martin, he robbed the rich and gave to the
poor, which none of you should believe makes the
crime any less wicked; especially as he did not scruple
to use violence in accomplishing his purpose.
For some small theft he was shut up in this prison;
but while the overseer was at church, H&ouml;yland broke
into his room, stole some of his clothes, and quietly
walked out of the castle and out of the town. He
was recaptured, but repeatedly made his escape.
Though he was heavily ironed, this precaution was
found to be useless, and he was placed in solitary confinement
in the lowest room of the citadel, where he
was kept securely for several years. One evening his
jailer told him that he could never get out of this
room, and that he might as well promise not to attempt
such an impossible feat; but H&ouml;yland replied
that it was the turnkey&#8217;s duty to keep him in prison if
he could, and his to get out if it were possible. The
next day the prisoner was missing, and the means of
his escape were not at first apparent; but on further
examination it was found that he had cut through the
thick plank flooring of his cell, under the bed, and
tunnelled under the wall into the yard of the prison.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
He had replaced the planks when he left, and passing
over the ramparts without difficulty, dropped into the
ditch, and departed without bidding any one good by.
All attempts to find him were unsuccessful, and it
was believed that he had left the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year afterwards the National Bank of Norway
was robbed of sixty thousand <em>specie-dalers</em>, in the most
adroit and skilful manner, even without leaving any
marks of violence on the iron box in which the money
was kept. Not long after this occurrence, in the person
of a prisoner who had been committed to the castle for
a petty theft, the officers recognized H&ouml;yland. He was
considerate enough to inform the authorities that his
late escape had been effected, after three years of patient
labor, with no other tool than a nail, while others
slept. As a portion of his ill-gotten wealth was concealed
in the mountains, he had the means of making
friends in Christiania, where he had hidden himself.
Making the acquaintance of the bank watchman, he
cunningly obtained wax impressions of the key-holes
of the locks on the money-chest, by which he made
keys, opened the box, took the money, and locked
it after him. But, like all other evil-doers, he came to
grief at last. Though he was a skilful carver in
wood and stone, he was not allowed to have tools, of
which he made a bad use, and he was compelled to
amuse himself by knitting socks on wooden pins.
Unable to escape again, and not having the patience
to exist without something to do, in utter despair he
committed suicide in his prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the visit to the fortress, the boys were allowed
to walk about the city at their own pleasure; and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
few of the officers went with Mr. Lowington and the
doctor to the establishment of Mr. Bennett, an Englishman,
who fitted out travellers intending to journey in
the interior with carioles and all the other requisites.
His rooms were stored with books and Norwegian
curiosities and antiquities. In the court-yard of the
house was a large number of second-hand carioles,
which are the sole vehicles used for crossing the country.
A traveller, wishing to go to Trondhjem or Bergen,
would purchase the cariole in Christiania, and
when he had done with it, dispose of it at the other
end of his route, horses between being supplied according
to law at the post stations on the road. Travellers
coming from Trondhjem or Bergen sell their vehicles
to Mr. Bennett. In his rooms are miniature
models of the cariole for sale, which visitors purchase
as a memento of their tour; as those who climb Pilatus
and Rhigi, in Switzerland, buy an alpenstock on
which are printed the names of the mountains they
have ascended with its help.</p>

<p>The principal and his companions walked up to the
Victoria Hotel, and inquired for Captain Kendall.
He had just returned from a ride, and while the
waiter was taking Mr. Lowington&#8217;s card to him,
Peaks presented himself in the court-yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t find him, sir,&rdquo; said the boatswain, touching
his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be somewhere in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man has toted me all over the town, but we
can&#8217;t hear a word of him. He wore the uniform of
the ship, and people can&#8217;t tell one student from another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am confident he has not left the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has,&rdquo; replied Peaks, as the servant
returned, followed by Captain Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lost anything or anybody?&rdquo; asked Paul,
laughing, after he had saluted the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have lost a student; an English boy we
shipped at Christiansand. Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; his room is No. 32&mdash;next to mine,&rdquo;
replied Paul, still laughing, as though he were much
amused.</p>

<p>He was much amused; and that others may sympathize
with him, let the reader return to Clyde Blacklock,
who had shut himself up in his room to await the
arrival of his mother. He had not been in the house
ten minutes before he began to be impatient and disgusted
with his self-imposed confinement. He examined
himself carefully in the looking-glass, and was satisfied
that his new clothes disguised him from his late
shipmates, and also from those whom he had met on
board of the Orlando. Certainly they had wrought
a very great change in his appearance, and with the
round-top hat on, which was entirely different from
anything he had worn before, even his mother would
not recognize him, unless they came near enough
together to enable her to scrutinize his features. Of
course none of the people from the squadron would
come to the hotel, and he had not yet been called
upon to register his name.</p>

<p>He unlocked his door, and went into the long entry
which opened into the court-yard. It was stupid to
stay alone in his chamber. It was some relief even to
promenade the hall, for one so nervous as he was at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
this time. If any of the Orlando&#8217;s passengers came
near him, he could retreat into his room. He walked
up and down several times, but this soon became stale
amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s in the next room to mine?&rdquo; he asked, as
one of the waiters passed him in his promenade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentleman and lady from America, sir,&rdquo; replied the
man; &ldquo;an uncommon handsome young woman, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the waiter could further express his opinion
of the guests in No. 31, Paul Kendall came out of the
room, and, seeing the servant, ordered a carriage to be
ready in half an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there much to see in this place, sir?&rdquo; asked
Clyde, politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, I think,&rdquo; replied Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are going into the interior, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is fine fishing there,&rdquo; persisted Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am told; but I haven&#8217;t much time to spend
in such sport, and I am afraid my wife would not
enjoy it as well as I should. Do you go to the interior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I intend to do so when my mother
and sister arrive. My mother goes a-fishing with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she, indeed? You are from England, I suppose,&rdquo;
added Paul, who suspected that the young
man was one of those lonesome travellers eager to
make a friend, and actually suffering from the want
of one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mockhill Manor, New Forest, Hampshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you travelling alone?&rdquo; asked Paul, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
full of sympathy for the apparent loneliness of the
young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am alone just now, but I expect my mother and
sister from Christiansand to-night,&rdquo; replied Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo; inquired Paul, who,
after this explanation, did not regard the young gentleman&#8217;s
situation as so hopeless.</p>

<p>In his own travels he had himself experienced that
sense of loneliness which is a decided misery, and
had met others afflicted with it. From the manner of
Clyde, he concluded he had an attack of it, and he
desired to alleviate his sufferings; but if the young
man&#8217;s friends were coming that night, his case could
not be desperate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I don&#8217;t know that you can. I thought, as
your room is next to mine, we might make it jolly for
each other. You are an American, sir, the waiter
says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; laughed Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&#8217;t talk through the nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t I? Well, I don&#8217;t perceive that you do,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not a Jonathan,&rdquo; protested Clyde. &ldquo;I dare
say you are a fine gentleman, but I can&#8217;t say that
of all the Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t you? Well, I&#8217;m sorry for them. Can you
say it of all the Englishmen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I think I can of all we meet travelling.
The Americans are big bullies. I settled accounts
with one of them this very day,&rdquo; chuckled Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! did you, indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think some of them know what it is to bully and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
insult an Englishman by this time,&rdquo; added Clyde, rubbing
his hands, as he thought of poor Peaks, floundering
in the waters of the Fjord. &ldquo;Perhaps you&#8217;ve heard
of that American Academy ship that came into Christiania
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard of her,&rdquo; answered Paul, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her first at Christiansand, and went on
board of her with my mother and sister. I liked the
looks of her, and fancied the young chaps on board of
her were having a nice time. I wanted to ship in her,
and I did so; but I was never among such a set of
tyrants in the whole course of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you joined the ship,&rdquo; replied Paul, who had
heard of the new addition to the Young America&#8217;s
crew, but had not seen him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m blamed if I didn&#8217;t; but before my mother left
the ship, a big bully of a boatswain insulted me, and I
changed my mind. Yet the head master persuaded
my mother to let him keep me in the ship, and I&#8217;m
blamed if she didn&#8217;t leave me there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left you there,&rdquo; added Paul, when Clyde paused,
apparently to give his auditor the opportunity to express
his sympathy for his unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; she left me there, and she won&#8217;t hear the
last of it for one year,&rdquo; replied Clyde, shaking his
head. &ldquo;It was a mean trick, and I&#8217;ll pay her for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably she did it for the best,&rdquo; suggested Paul,
disgusted with the assurance, and especially with the
want of respect for his mother which the youth manifested,
though he was anxious to hear the conclusion
of his story.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care what she did it for; it was a scurvy
trick. I told her I wouldn&#8217;t stay in the ship, any how,
and she permitted the big boatswain to hold me while
she went ashore in a boat. But I knew myself, if my
mother didn&#8217;t know me, and I determined not to stay
in her three days; and I didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; chuckled Clyde, as he
thought of what he called his own cleverness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked Paul, deeply interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was willing to bide my time, and so I hauled
sheets, and luffed, and tacked, and all that sort of thing,
till we got to Christiania. When I was pulling the
main boom, or something of that kind,&mdash;I don&#8217;t just
know what it was now,&mdash;one of the fellows in gold
bands insulted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ordered me to be silent, and another nob did
the same thing. I offered to fight them both, and I
would have liked to show them what an English boy&#8217;s
fist is made of; but the cowards set the boatswain on
me again. I would have licked him if he had fought
fair; but he caught me foul, and I could do nothing.
I meant to be even with that big boatswain, and I think
I am,&rdquo; said Clyde, rubbing his hands again with delight,
and laughing heartily when he thought of his
brilliant achievement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just waited till the ship got to Christiania; and
then, when all the students were at dinner, I found the
big boatswain sitting on a beam that runs out over the
water&mdash;I forget what they call the beam, but it&#8217;s at
the bow of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bowsprit,&rdquo; suggested Paul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
&ldquo;No; I know the bowsprit. It wasn&#8217;t that. There
was another beam like it on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, the cat-head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just it. Well, I went up to the big boatswain,
and asked him to look at a ship,&mdash;or a &#8217;mofferdite
brig, he called it. He looked, and I just gave him
a push, which dropped him off the cat&#8217;s head into
the bay,&rdquo; continued Clyde, who told his story with
many a chuckle and many a laugh, seeming to enjoy
it hugely himself, in spite of the want of sympathy
on the part of his listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pushed him overboard!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I did, and did it handsomely, too. He never
knew what hurt him till he struck the water. He
swam for the bow, and I dropped into a boat, and
came ashore. I saw him climb up to the deck, but
I was out of his way then. Wasn&#8217;t that cleverly
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; replied Paul, concealing his indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was very cleverly done,&rdquo; added Clyde,
annoyed at the coolness of his companion. &ldquo;You
couldn&#8217;t have done it better yourself, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think I could,&rdquo; replied Paul, dryly. &ldquo;And
you expect your mother this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and she shall take my name off the books
of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but she will. Then the two nobs that insulted
me on the ship shall hear from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll whip them both; if I don&#8217;t my name isn&#8217;t
Clyde Blacklock!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
&ldquo;But they will take you back to the ship before
your mother arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say they will, if they see me; but I don&#8217;t
intend to go out of the hotel till my mother comes. I
shall stay in my room, or near it, the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the appearance
of Mrs. Kendall, who had been preparing for a ride
about the city. Paul conducted her to the carriage,
satisfied that the new scholar could be found when
wanted. During their excursion he told his wife the
adventures of Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what a simpleton he was to tell you these
things!&rdquo; added Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not suspect me of knowing anything about
the ship. He is one of those fellows, who, having done
what he regards as a good thing, cannot help boasting
of it. He considers himself a first-class hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Paul returned from the ride, he found Clyde
still walking about the hall, as uneasy as a fish out of
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of the Academy ship, sir?&rdquo;
asked he, after Mrs. Kendall had gone to her room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her at anchor in the harbor, and all her people
are walking about the town,&rdquo; replied Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve kept clear of them so far; but I want to catch
the two fellows with the gold bands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some of them will catch you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they! I&#8217;m too cunning for clumsy fellows
like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you are,&rdquo; laughed Paul, amused at the assurance
of the young Briton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I see them, I&#8217;ll settle the Alabama claims with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
them on my own account. But you ought to have
seen the big boatswain floundering in the water, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it was very funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, indeed,&rdquo; added Clyde, as the waiter appeared,
and handed a card to Captain Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the court yard, sir,&rdquo; said the servant; and Paul
followed the man to the place where the visitors were
waiting.</p>

<p>Peaks, as dry, clean, and good-natured as ever, was
talking to Mr. Lowington. Paul could not help laughing
as he thought of the confidence which Clyde had
reposed in him, and that the fugitive had voluntarily,
and without any precautions, told his adventures to
one who really belonged to the fleet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has told me all about it,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told you?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; how he pushed Peaks overboard, and
then ran away,&rdquo; laughed Paul. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t often wear
my uniform on shore, for my wife thinks it attracts too
much attention; so that he did not suspect me of any
connection with the fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is he now?&rdquo; asked the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left him in the hall only a moment since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me his room, my hearty,&rdquo; said Peaks to the
waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call a carriage,&rdquo; added Mr. Lowington. &ldquo;He will
make a disturbance in the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant led the way to the room of Clyde, followed
by the rest of the party. All were rather anxious
to see the clever Briton, who had done such wonders
of valor and cunning, captured.</p>

<p>But Clyde had a pair of eyes, and, withal, a pair of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
ears. From the hall where he promenaded were several
doors opening into the court-yard. Perhaps the
youth had a Yankee&#8217;s curiosity to see who called upon
his new acquaintance, and he went to one of these
doors. He saw Paul walk up to the principal, and
shake hands with him. There was the big boatswain
too, and there were two of the nobs with the gold
bands. It was evident enough to Clyde, then, that
he had made a blunder in relating his exploits to a
stranger. But the battle was not lost yet. His chamber
was on the ground floor, and had a window which
opened into Dronningensgaden. Without losing another
instant, he opened the window, and dropped out
into the street. He did not even wait to take the bundle
which contained his ship&#8217;s uniform.</p>

<p>When Peaks entered the chamber, the bird had
flown, and the open window indicated the means by
which he had escaped; but Clyde had several minutes
the start of his pursuers, and had made good use
of his time. The boatswain dropped out of the window,
followed by Norwood and Lincoln, while the
principal and the doctor went round by the doors as
the more dignified means of egress. Peaks went one
way, and the two lieutenants the other way.</p>

<p>Clyde, fearful that haste might look suspicious,
walked a short distance, till he came to a building on
which was a sign, <em>H&ocirc;tel du Nord</em>, and which appeared
to be under repairs. He stepped in at the open
door, and went up stairs. Men were at work in some
of the rooms; but he avoided them, and appeared to be
looking over the building. At last he came to an open
window on the street from which he had entered. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
looked out, and in the distance saw his pursuers running
rapidly in opposite directions. After he had remained
in the hotel about an hour, he ventured to
leave, and walked very cautiously up the street. Feeling
the need of an overcoat, he entered a store, and
purchased one, which still further disguised him, so
that if he met any of his late shipmates, they would
be still less likely to recognize him. He walked till
he came to a carriage stand; where, entering a vehicle,
he pointed in the direction he wished to go, which
was towards the king&#8217;s palace. When the driver
stopped at the gate, he pointed towards the hills in
the rear of the city. The Norwegian looked astonished,
and could not understand him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go out of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The driver drove his horse to the other side of the
street, and hailed a short, stout man, who was passing
at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want a guide, sir?&rdquo; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; promptly replied Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do wish to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; replied Clyde, pointing again in the
direction he wished to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Sandviken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&#8217;s the place,&rdquo; added the youth, who did
not care where he went, if he could only get out of
the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more than eight miles,&rdquo; suggested the guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care if it is eighty; that&#8217;s where I want to
go. Are you a <em>commissionaire</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I belong to the Victoria Hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; jump in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The man made a bargain with the driver, and in a
few moments Clyde was on his way to Sandviken,
confident that he had escaped any further pursuit. He
had already come to the conclusion not to see his
mother until after the Young America had left Christiania.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Peaks had given up the chase.
Paul assured the principal that Clyde would come back
as soon as his mother arrived. Mr. Lowington did
not care to have the new scholar see his mother again
if he was to be a student in the Academy; but as
Clyde could not be found, there appeared to be no
alternative.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours, the fugitive reached Sandviken,
where he informed his astonished guide that he
intended to proceed to Christiansand by land. His
courier was willing to go with him so long as he was
paid; and as Clyde had plenty of money, and disbursed
it freely, there was no difficulty. Though the next day
was Sunday, the young traveller continued his journey,
and on Monday afternoon arrived at Apalst&ouml;, at
the head of one of the inland lakes, where he intended
to sleep; but the station-house was full. Clyde was
tired, and did not feel like going any farther. While he
was sending his courier to look up a bed for him,
about a dozen boys wearing the uniform of the Academy
ship flashed upon his view. He was astonished
and alarmed. He suspected that this party had been
sent to the interior to head him off. He was determined
not to be an easy victim.</p>

<p>One of the party had a good-sized salmon in his
hand, which indicated that they had been a-fishing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
They took no notice of him, though they could not
help seeing him, and Clyde took courage from this circumstance.</p>

<p>The fishing squad was composed of the crew of the
second cutter&mdash;the unfortunates who had been run
down by the steamer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE EXCURSION WITHOUT RUNNING AWAY.</strong></p>


<p>The second cutter was a wreck on the water,
and the crew saved themselves by climbing up
the bow of the steamer which had run down the boat.
They received prompt assistance from those on board,
and, as the cutter did not sink, and would not have
done so, having no ballast, even if she had been cut
in two, the crew were so well trained that not one
of them was guilty of the absurdity of jumping overboard,
and therefore no one was even very wet.</p>

<p>It appeared to be one of those cases where both
parties had struggled to avoid the catastrophe, but
the more they struggled the worse was the situation.
If the cutter, on the one hand, had continued on her
course, she would have escaped. If the steamer, on
the other hand, had not changed her course when the
calamity was threatened, the boat could have avoided
her. The change of purpose in each had confused
the other, and rendered unavailing the attempt to
avoid the collision. The boat would have gone clear
of the steamer if the latter had not put her helm to
starboard. But the catastrophe was accomplished so
quickly that there was not much time to philosophize;
and as nothing worse than a stove boat had resulted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
from it, there was not much reason to complain. We
are not aware that any one did complain; and we
only state the appearances, not the facts.</p>

<p>The steamer started her wheels again after the
cutter had been secured and made fast astern. The
captain spoke only a few words of English, and Sanford
found it quite impossible to hold a conversation
with him. But Ole Amundsen was at hand in this
emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him he needn&#8217;t stop for us, Ole,&rdquo; said the
coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you want to return to the ship?&rdquo; asked the
astonished waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Sanford, in a low tone, so that
some of the doubtful members of his crew might not
hear him. &ldquo;Where is the steamer going, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Christiania, stopping at all the ports on the
coast,&rdquo; answered Ole, when he had obtained the information
from the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; we will go to the first place where she
stops,&rdquo; added Sanford. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t say a word to the rest
of the fellows, Ole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first port she stops at is Lillesand,&rdquo; said Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; we will go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole explained to the captain that the boys he had
picked up wished to go to Lillesand, where they could
join their ship. This plan exactly suited the young
Norwegian, for he did not like the idea of being landed
at Christiansand, or taken back to the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going? Why don&#8217;t he put us on
shore, or on board of the ship?&rdquo; demanded Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a mail steamer; she is very late,&rdquo; replied Ole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
&ldquo;But is she going to carry us off, because she is in
a hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to a port up here a little ways. We can
come right back in another steamer,&rdquo; Ole explained;
and Burchmore was satisfied.</p>

<p>Now, the captain had certainly declared that he was
in a great hurry, and was not willing to wait for the
boat which had put off from the ship; but he proposed
to hail a boat which was passing, and send his
involuntary passengers to the town in her. Ole assured
him his companions wished to go to Lillesand,
and he was too glad to avoid any delay. As the first
cutter followed the steamer, it was decided, after consultation
with the captain, to turn the stove boat adrift,
so that it could be towed back to the ship by the first
cutters. Sanford cast off the painter, and the pliant
master of the steamer was glad to get rid of this check
upon the speed of his boat. The boys watched the
water-logged craft till it was picked up by the first
cutter, and then passing behind an island, the squadron
was out of view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you here, Ole?&rdquo; asked Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Came in the boat; but I didn&#8217;t think you were
going to smash her. I thought I was killed that time,
sure,&rdquo; laughed the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how came you in the boat?&rdquo; inquired Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got in, of course; nobody put me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it hung at the davits in the ship, just before
the pilot came on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you get in there for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My education has been neglected, and I have to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
do a great deal of thinking to make up for it. I don&#8217;t
like to be disturbed when I&#8217;m thinking; so I got into
the boat, and covered myself with the sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the fishes,&rdquo; snuffed Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can, if you wish; I don&#8217;t speak their language,&rdquo;
laughed Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But really, Norway, what did you get into the
second cutter for?&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pilot was a first cousin of mine, and I was
afraid he would whip me for making faces at him
when I was a baby. He never forgets anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you know better than I, don&#8217;t ask me
any more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole was no more inclined to explain how he came
in the second cutter than he had been to solve the
mystery of being in a water-logged bateau, out of sight
of land. It only appeared that while the students
covered the rail and crowded the rigging to see the
land, he had put himself into the boat. When the
hands were called to man the braces, he, having no
duty to perform, had not answered the call, and was
left alone in the cutter. At sea, every precaution was
taken to provide for the safety of the crew in case of
any calamity. Each boat was provided with a sail, a
mast, a compass, and several breakers of water, and
a quantity of provisions was ready to be put in when
needed. Ole stowed himself beneath the sail, which
lay under the middle board, extending fore and aft.
Before De Forrest took his place in the stern-sheets,
Stockwell had discovered the absentee, and communicated
the fact of his presence to those near him. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
crew of the second cutter were entirely willing to
keep his secret, as they were that of any one who
needed their help. Among such boys it was regarded
as dishonorable in the highest degree to betray any
one; and, indeed, the principal discountenanced anything
like &ldquo;tale-bearing,&rdquo; to which the students gave
a very liberal construction. Sanford had proposed
that De Forrest should take a walk on shore, in order
to give Ole an opportunity to escape from his confinement,
which, on account of the singular obstinacy
and suspicion of that officer, had threatened to be indefinitely
continued, till the collision came to his aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;s this?&rdquo; said Stockwell, as he seated himself
by the side of the coxswain, on one of the settees
on the quarter-deck of the steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;s what?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that we are clear of the ship, and
without running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t say a word. We got spilled out the boat,
and it was not our doing. We obeyed De Forrest&#8217;s
orders to the very letter, so that no fault can be found
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If De Forrest had not ordered me to shove off, I
shouldn&#8217;t have done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the boat might have been ground up on the
rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything green in my eye?&rdquo; replied
Sanford, suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to say that you smashed the boat
on purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I don&#8217;t mean to <em>say</em> anything of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sort. I obey orders if I break owners, or boats either,
for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. The programme is to go back in
the steamer that returns to Christiansand to-morrow
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, then you mean to go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your head&#8217;s as thick as the broadside of an iron-clad.
Of course I mean to go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the next boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stockwell did not exactly like the sharp way with
which Sanford dealt with his innocence. Certainly
the coxswain and himself had talked about an excursion
to the interior of Norway without running away;
but now, though the circumstances favored the plan,
his friend plainly announced his intention to return to
Christiansand and join the ship. But it could be said
of the coxswain that his ways were dark, and Stockwell
was more inclined to wait than to question him.
In two hours the steamer arrived at Lillesand, and the
party went on shore. The place was only a small
village, but they found accommodations for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time does the steamer for Christiansand
leave this place?&rdquo; asked Sanford, as the party gathered
at the station-house, which is the hotel, post-office,
and establishment for furnishing horses to
travellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow evening,&rdquo; replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow evening!&rdquo; exclaimed the coxswain.
&ldquo;That will never do! What time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About eight o&#8217;clock,&rdquo; answered the waif, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
devotion to the truth did not prevent him from stating
the time two hours later than the fact warranted.
&ldquo;She may be two or three hours later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The squadron sails for Christiania to-morrow afternoon,&rdquo;
added Sanford. &ldquo;The ship will be gone before
we can get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will not go without us,&rdquo; suggested Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she will,&rdquo; said Stockwell, who was beginning
to fathom the dark ways of the coxswain. &ldquo;The
principal will suppose we have gone on to Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do?&rdquo; demanded Tinckner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the question,&rdquo; added Sanford, with a blank
look, as though he considered the situation as utterly
hopeless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not so badly off as we might be,&rdquo; said
Boyden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see how it could be any worse,&rdquo; replied
Sanford. &ldquo;But I don&#8217;t know that it is our fault.
The captain of the steamer would not stop, after he
had picked us up; at least, I don&#8217;t know anything
about it; but Ole said he wouldn&#8217;t stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not stop,&rdquo; protested the waif, vehemently.
&ldquo;He had only just time enough to reach Frederiksv&aelig;rn
in season for the other steamer. If he lost
her, he would be turned off. He wouldn&#8217;t stop for
love or money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter, for that; here we are, and what are we
going to do? It&#8217;s no use to cry for spilled milk,&rdquo; continued
Stockwell. &ldquo;The ship will go to Christiania,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and won&#8217;t come near this place. Mr. Lowington will
expect to find us there when he arrives, and all we
have to do is to make good his calculation. We have
plenty of money, and we can get there somehow or
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Involuntarily, every fellow put his hands into his
pocket; and then, if not before, they recalled the
suggestion of the coxswain, made before they took
their places in the cutter, that they should bring their
money and their pea-jackets; but then, it seemed
simply absurd that the boat had been smashed by his
contrivance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it for this, Sanford, that you told us to bring
our money?&rdquo; said Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say a fellow ought always to carry his
money with him. No one can tell what will happen
to him when he goes away from the ship,&rdquo; replied the
coxswain. &ldquo;You can see that it&#8217;s lucky you have it
with you. We might have to spend the summer here
if we had no money. When will a steamer go from
here to Christiania, Norway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next Friday&mdash;just a week from to-day,&rdquo; replied
the Norwegian, very seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week!&rdquo; exclaimed Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not long; a week is soon gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&#8217;t stay here a week,&rdquo; protested Tinckner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want to do it,&rdquo; added Sanford; &ldquo;but if we
have to do it, I suppose I can stand it as well as the
rest of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&#8217;t any of us stand it,&rdquo; said Wilde. &ldquo;Who&#8217;s
going to stay a week in such a place as this? I&#8217;m
not, for one. I&#8217;ll swim up to Christiansand first.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can&#8217;t we hire a boat, and go back to Christiansand?&rdquo;
Burchmore proposed. &ldquo;It is not more than
twenty miles, and it would be a fine sail among these
beautiful islands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; look up a boat, Norway,&rdquo; replied Sanford,
as though entirely willing to adopt this plan.</p>

<p>Ole walked about the place for half an hour, accompanied
by three of the boys. Perhaps he was
careful not to find what he wanted; at any rate, no
boat seemed to be available for the purpose desired,
and when the excursionists met again, it was reported
that no boat suitable for the accommodation of the
party could be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then can&#8217;t we engage horses, and go round to
Christiansand by land?&rdquo; inquired Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In carioles?&rdquo; queried Ole, with an odd smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carioles or wagons; anything we can find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can, but it will take you a day and a half,&rdquo;
replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A day and a half to go twenty miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About seventy miles by land,&rdquo; added Ole. &ldquo;You
must go almost up to the north pole before you can
cross the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Burchmore, who could
not help feeling that Ole was not altogether reliable
on his figures and facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&#8217;t believe it, go and ask the postmaster,
or any one in the town,&rdquo; continued the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all very well to talk about asking any one,
when no one speaks a syllable of English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do the talking for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will; you have done it all thus far.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mean to say that you must really double
the north pole, or that it is just seventy miles by land;
but it&#8217;s a long distance,&rdquo; Ole explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter how far it is; we will go,&rdquo; added the
pliant coxswain. &ldquo;I&#8217;m willing to do whatever the
fellows wish. It shall not be said that I was mulish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it is seventy miles, or anything like it, we
couldn&#8217;t get to Christiansand before the ship left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just what I was thinking,&rdquo; answered Sanford,
with a puzzled expression on his face. &ldquo;Ole
says it is a long way, and I have been told that these
Norwegians are very honest, and will not lie; so I
suppose he has told the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was barely possible that the waif had learned to
lie in England, where he had acquired his English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we must give up the idea of going in a
boat, or going by land. We can only wait till the
steamer comes,&rdquo; continued Burchmore, putting on a
very long face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&#8217;t stand that,&rdquo; protested Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t you tell us, Norway?&rdquo; said Tinckner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I should do if I were in your situation,
and wanted to make a sure thing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; asked Burchmore, gathering a
hope from the words of the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should go to Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By land, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s up by the north pole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about a hundred and fifty miles from here by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
water, and it can&#8217;t be any more by land,&rdquo; said Sanford.
&ldquo;But I don&#8217;t care what you do; I will do as the others
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the idea,&rdquo; added Stockwell. &ldquo;It is the only
safe thing we can do. If we go back to Christiansand,
we shall be too late for the ship. If we wait for
a steamer to Christiania, she will be gone when we
get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will it cost to go to Christiania in this
way?&rdquo; inquired Wilde, who did not feel quite sure
that his funds would stand such a drain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are the prices in the post-house,&rdquo; said Ole,
as he led the way to a partition on which the posting
was put up. &ldquo;For one mile, one mark six skillings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know all about it now,&rdquo; laughed Rodman.
&ldquo;What&#8217;s a mark, and what&#8217;s a skilling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four skillings make a mark, and a skilling
is about a halfpenny English,&rdquo; Ole explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a cent of our money,&rdquo; continued Rodman.
&ldquo;One mark and six skillings would be thirty skillings,
or about thirty cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will never do,&rdquo; interposed Wilde, shaking
his head. &ldquo;One hundred and fifty miles, at thirty
cents a mile, would be forty-five dollars; and I suppose
we have to pay for our grub besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would come to ten or twelve pounds, and
Wilde has only ten pounds,&rdquo; added Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; you are all wrong. That means a
Norwegian mile&mdash;about seven of ours. It would be
only four and two sevenths cents a mile; say, six or
seven dollars to Christiania; and the grub would cost
as much more,&rdquo; said Stockwell. &ldquo;Three pounds will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
cover the whole expense, and that won&#8217;t break any
body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After considerable discussion, it was agreed to adopt
the plan proposed, and Ole was instructed to make
the necessary arrangements with the station-master.
The party went out to the stable to examine the carioles.
They were a kind of gig, without any hood or
top, with a small board behind, on which stands or
sits the boy who drives the team back to the station
after it has left the passenger. Tourists generally purchase
the carioles in which they ride, and are not bothered
with the boys. The students were not very nice
about their accommodations; and finding that when
two persons went in the same vehicle only half a fare
extra was charged, they decided to engage but five carioles.
As the law did not require the station-master to
keep this number of horses in waiting, it was necessary
to send &ldquo;forbud&rdquo; before the party started. This
was an order to all the stations on the road to have
five horses ready, and may be forwarded by mail or
by special messenger, the expense of which was paid
by the young tourists.</p>

<p>It was solemnly agreed that the expense should be
equally divided, and Burchmore was elected cashier
and paymaster. With the assistance of Ole, he
changed twelve pounds into Norwegian money, and
found himself heavily loaded with the small coins of the
country, which would be needed in making change at
the stations. After all this important business had
been disposed of, the party walked all over the town
and its suburbs, and were duly stared at by the astonished
people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
&ldquo;We ought to write a letter to Mr. Lowington, and
tell him how we are situated,&rdquo; suggested Churchill, as
they were returning to the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; and carry it to him ourselves,&rdquo; replied
Stockwell. &ldquo;I move you that Burchmore be
appointed bearer of despatches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to have the letter sent by mail,&rdquo; added
Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be in Christiania as soon as any mail, if
there is no steamer for a week,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True; I didn&#8217;t think of that,&rdquo; continued the proposer
of this precaution. &ldquo;The principal will be
worried about us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him worry,&rdquo; replied the coxswain; &ldquo;that is,
we can&#8217;t do anything to relieve his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see that we can,&rdquo; added Churchill.</p>

<p>For the want of something better to do, the students
turned in at an early hour in the evening, and turned
out at an early hour in the morning. They all slept
in the same room, some of them in beds, and the rest
on the floor; but those who slept on the floor were just
as well satisfied as those who slept in the beds. After
a breakfast consisting mainly of fish, they piled
into the carioles. They were all in exceedingly jolly
humor, and seated themselves in and on the vehicles in
various uncouth postures. One boy in each cariole
was to drive the horse, and he was carefully instructed
to do nothing but simply hold the reins, and let the
well-informed animal have his own way. The horses
were rather small, and very shaggy beasts; but
they went off at a lively pace. At the first hill they
insisted upon walking up, and most of the boys followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
their example. Behind three of the carioles
were the small boys who were to bring the teams back.
These juvenile Norwegians were as sober and dignified
as though they had been members of the Storthing,
refusing to laugh at any of the wild tantrums
of the crazy students.</p>

<p>At the first station, where the road from Lillesand
joins that from Christiansand to the north, the horses
ordered by &ldquo;forbud&rdquo; were in readiness, and the party
had only to pass from one set of carioles to another.
The grim post-boys did smile faintly when they received
their perquisites, and others, just as immovable,
took their places for the next post. The road now lay
along the banks of a considerable river, and the scenery
was rather interesting, though by no means grand.
They passed an occasional farm; but generally the
buildings were of the rudest and shabbiest description,
though occasionally there was a neat residence,
painted white or yellow, with roof of red tile. The
boys walked up all the hills, leaving the sagacious
horses to take care of themselves. All the students
voted that it was jolly to travel in this manner, and
there was no end to the sky-larking and racing on
the road. At noon, they stopped long enough to
dine, and at night found themselves at Tvetsund, at
the foot of Nisser Lake, where they lodged. As this
was as far as they had sent their &ldquo;forbud,&rdquo; they decided
to proceed by boat through the lake, a distance
of about twenty miles.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, which was always observed
with great strictness on board of the ship,
no play and no unnecessary work being permitted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
There was a little church in the village, but none but
Ole could understand a word of the preacher&#8217;s prayer
or sermon; so that the students voted it would be useless
for them to go there. Four of the party, still controlled
by the influences which prevailed on board of
the ship, did not wish to travel on Sunday; but when
it was represented that the ship might leave Christiania
before the party arrived, they yielded to the
wishes of the other five, and procuring boats, they proceeded
on their way. At the head of the lake they
took the road, and walked about seven miles to
Apalst&ouml;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are stuck here,&rdquo; said Sanford, after they had
taken supper at the station-house. &ldquo;This posting is a
first-class fraud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Burchmore,
alarmed by the manner of the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No horses to be had till Tuesday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a fraud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&#8217;t be helped,&rdquo; added Sanford, philosophically.
&ldquo;I&#8217;m willing to walk, if the rest of the
fellows say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&#8217;t walk to Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; and we should not find any more horses
at the next station than here. Norway says we didn&#8217;t
send &lsquo;forbud,&rsquo; which must be done when more than
three horses are wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t Ole send &lsquo;forbud,&rsquo; then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said we had better go by boat part of the way;
it would be easier. But part of us can take the three
horses that are ready, and go on with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe in separating.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
&ldquo;We are only a day and a half from Christiania,
and we shall arrive by Wednesday noon. The ship
won&#8217;t leave before that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Burchmore was persuaded to submit to his fate
like a philosopher, which, however, was not considered
very hard, when it was announced that there was
excellent fishing in the vicinity. It is to be feared that
Ole and the coxswain had created this hinderance themselves,
for the law of the country allows only three
hours&#8217; delay in the furnishing of horses. The farmers
are compelled to supply them, and doubtless twenty
could have been provided in the time allowed, though
the young tourists were able to give twelve hours&#8217; notice.
This, however, did not suit the coxswain&#8217;s purposes,
and as he and Ole had occupied the same cariole,
there was no want of concert in their words and
actions. On Monday the students went a-fishing,
paying a small sum for a license to do so, though this
is not necessary in all parts of Norway. The united
catch of the whole party was one salmon, taken by
Burchmore, and weighing about eight pounds. It was
voted by the party, before this result was reached, in
the middle of the afternoon, that fishing in Norway
was &ldquo;a first-class fraud.&rdquo; We heard of a party of
three, who fished two weeks, and caught eight salmon,
though this want of luck is the exception, rather than
the rule, in the north.</p>

<p>As the party returned from their excursion, bearing
the single trophy of their patience, Clyde Blacklock
discovered them. He was alarmed at first, but when
he recognized no one among them whom he had seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
on board of the ship, he concluded they did not belong
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing Sanford,
who seemed to be the chief of the excursionists.
&ldquo;You have been a-fishing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and ten of us have one fish to show for a
whole day&#8217;s work,&rdquo; laughed the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor luck; but you seem to be sailors,&rdquo; continued
the Briton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We belong to the ship Young America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In half an hour Clyde and Sanford were on excellent
terms. The former, when he learned that his
new acquaintance had not been sent after him, was
quite communicative, and even told the story of his
experience on board of the ship, and of his escape
from bondage. Sanford laughed, and seemed to enjoy
the narrative; but straightway the coxswain began
to tremble when he learned that Clyde had with
him a Norwegian who spoke English. It was necessary
to get rid of so dangerous a person without any
delay. The Briton liked Sanford so well that he was
not willing to leave him; and, indeed, the whole party
were so jolly that he desired to join his fortunes with
theirs. Sanford wrote a brief letter to Mr. Lowington,
stating the misfortunes of the party, and that they
expected to arrive in Christiania on Wednesday or
Thursday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, I don&#8217;t know your name,&rdquo; said
Sanford, when he found Clyde, after he had written
the epistle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
&ldquo;Blacklock,&rdquo; replied the Briton&mdash;&ldquo;Clyde Blacklock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Blacklock, if you want an up-and-down good
time, come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where? To Christiania? into the lion&#8217;s den?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but&mdash;don&#8217;t open your mouth; don&#8217;t let
on for the world,&rdquo; whispered the coxswain, glancing
at his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; added Clyde, satisfied he had found
the right friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to the Rjukanfos to-morrow, but
only one or two of us know it yet. Your man will
spoil all. Send him back to Christiania this very afternoon.
Here&#8217;s a blind for him; let him take this
letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde liked plotting and mischief, and as soon as
his guide had eaten his supper, he was started for
his home in the capital, glad enough to go, for he had been
paid for all the time agreed upon; and Sanford
ceased to tremble lest he should expose to his companions
the mistake in regard to horses, or another
blunder which was to be made the next morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GOTTENBURG AND FINKEL.</strong></p>


<p>On Saturday night, as Clyde had anticipated, his
mother arrived at Christiania; and the people
at the Victoria informed her of the disappearance of
her son. The next morning she hastened on board of
the ship, and heard the principal&#8217;s story. Mrs. Blacklock
wept bitterly, and was fearful that her darling
boy was forever lost; but Mr. Lowington assured her
that no serious harm could befall him. He spoke very
plainly to her in regard to Clyde&#8217;s character and his
ungovernable passions, assuring her that he must certainly
come to an evil end within a few years, if he
was not restrained and controlled. The poor mother
felt the truth of all he said, and was willing that he
should continue the beneficent work upon which he
had commenced. She spent the forenoon on board,
and was introduced to Kendall and Shuffles and their
ladies. The principal illustrated what he had said
about Clyde by relating the history of the present
captain and owner of the Feodora, and Mrs. Blacklock
went away even hopeful that her boy might yet be
saved to her.</p>

<p>On Monday, the first secular day of the month, the
new list of officers was announced in each vessel of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the squadron. The changes on board of the ship were
not very violent, though the third lieutenant became
captain, while Cumberland became the commodore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you, Captain Lincoln,&rdquo; said Dr.
Winstock to the new commander, when he appeared
in the uniform of his new rank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been satisfied for some time that you would
attain this position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only sorry to be promoted over Judson and
Norwood, for they have always been good friends of
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they are good and true friends they will rejoice
at your success, though it places you over them. You
have worked very hard, and you are fully entitled to
your rank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I have tried to do my duty,&rdquo;
replied Lincoln, modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I see a young gentleman use the library as
freely as you do, I am always tolerably confident that
he will attain a high rank. We go on shore this forenoon,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard we were to make an excursion to-day,
and another to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see something of the interior of Norway,
after all, though it is not quite possible to transport
two hundred boys over a country where the facilities
for travel are so meagre,&rdquo; added the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part, I should like to walk, even a hundred
miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not practicable. How could such a crowd
be lodged and fed, in some of the small villages where
you would be compelled to pass the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
&ldquo;I suppose it would not be possible, and I shall be
satisfied with whatever the principal thinks best,&rdquo;
replied the captain.</p>

<p>The students were called to muster, and Mr. Lowington
explained that he proposed to spend the day,
in picnic style, at Frogner S&aelig;ter, and that the party
would walk. The boats were then prepared, and the
crews of the several vessels went on shore. Captains
Kendall and Shuffles procured carriages, for the ladies
were not able to walk so far. Passing out of the
more densely settled portions of the city, the excursionists
came to a delightful region, abounding in
pleasant residences, some of which were grand and
lofty. For a time the landscape was covered with
small cottages, painted white or yellow; but as they
proceeded they came to a country very sparsely settled,
and very similar to that of New England. The
road lay through woods of pine and fir, and had been
constructed by Mr. Heftye, a public-spirited citizen,
who owned a large estate at the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This looks just like Maine,&rdquo; said Captain Lincoln,
who walked at the side of Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly like it. There is a house, however, which
is hardly so good as those you see in Maine,&rdquo; replied
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&#8217;t any better than a shanty, and the barn is
as good as the house. I wonder what that is for;&rdquo;
and Lincoln pointed to a bunch of straw, on the top
of a pole, at the entrance of the barn. &ldquo;I have seen
two or three of those here, and near Christiansand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was grain placed there for the birds during the
winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s very kind of the people, I must say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are very kind to all their animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Near the summit of the hill, the party came to the
summer-house of Mr. Heftye, a very neat structure of
wood, with a piazza, from which is obtained a beautiful
view of the surrounding country. Another half
hour brought them to the top of the hill, where the
proprietor had erected a wooden tower, or observatory.
It was some sixty or seventy feet high, and was
stayed with rope guys, extending to the trees on four
sides, to prevent it from being blown over. Only
twenty of the boys were permitted to go up at one
time, for the wind was tolerably fresh, and the structure
swayed to and fro like the mast of a ship in a sea.
From the top, mountains fifty miles distant could be
seen. Christiania Fjord lay like a panorama in the
distance, stretching as far as the eye could reach. To
the west the country looked wild and desolate, and
was covered with wood-crowned mountains, though
none of any considerable height could be seen. It
was a magnificent view, and some of the most enthusiastic
of the students declared that it was worth a
voyage to Norway; but boys are proverbially extravagant.</p>

<p>A couple of hours were spent on the hill, the lunch
was eaten, and the boys declared that they were well
rested. The return walk was not so pleasant, for the
novelties of the region had been exhausted. The road
passed through private property, where there were at
least a dozen gates across it in different places; and
as the party approached, a woman, a boy, or a girl
appeared, to open them. Kendall or Shuffles rewarded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
each of them with a few skillings for the service.
When their two and four skilling pieces were exhausted,
they were obliged to use larger coins, rather
than be mean; but it was observed that the Norwegians
themselves, though able to ride in a carriage,
never gave anything. It was amusing to see the astonishment
of the boys and girls when they received
an eight skilling piece, and the haste with which they
ran to their parents to exhibit the prize.</p>

<p>The party reached the vessels at five o&#8217;clock, and
after supper the boats were again in demand for a
visit to Oscarshal, the white summer palace, which
could be seen from the ship. Mr. Bennett had provided
the necessary tickets, and made the arrangements
for the excursion. It is certainly a very pretty
place, but there are a hundred country residences in
the vicinity of New York, Boston, or any other large
city of the United States, which excel it in beauty
and elegance, as well as in the expense lavished upon
them. Before returning to the anchorage, the boat
squadron pulled about for a couple of hours among
the beautiful islands, and when the students returned
to the fleet, they felt that they had about exhausted
Christiania and its environs.</p>

<p>The next day they went by the railroad train to
Eidsvold, and there embarked in the steamer Kong
Oscar for a voyage of sixty-five miles up the Mjosen
Lake to Lillehammer, where they arrived at half past
five in the afternoon. The scenery of the lake is
pleasant, but not grand, the slope of the hills being
covered with farms. Near the upper end, the hills
are higher, and the aspect is more picturesque. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of the western boys thought it looked like the shores
of the Ohio River, others compared it with the Delaware,
and a New Hampshire youth considered it
more like Lake Winnipiseogee.</p>

<p>Lillehammer is a small town of seventeen hundred
inhabitants. M. Hammer&#8217;s and Madame Ormsrud&#8217;s
hotel were not large enough to accommodate the
party, and they began to experience some of the difficulties
of travelling in such large numbers; but Mr.
Bennett had done his work well, and sleeping-rooms
were provided in other houses for the rest. The
tourists rambled all over the town and its vicinity,
looked into the saw-mills, visited the farms, and compared
the agriculture with that of their own country;
and it must be added that Norway suffered very much
in the comparison, for the people are slow to adopt
innovations upon the methods of their fathers.</p>

<p>Early in the morning&mdash;for steamers in Norway
and Sweden have a villanous practice of starting at
unseemly hours&mdash;the students embarked for Eidsvold,
and were on board the vessels long before the late
sunset. On the quarter, waiting for the principal,
was Clyde&#8217;s courier, who had arrived that morning,
after the departure of the excursionists. He evidently
had not hurried his journey, though he had been told
to do so. He delivered Sanford&#8217;s brief note, which
was written in pencil, and Mr. Lowington read it.
The absentees were safe and well, and would arrive
by Thursday. He was glad to hear of their safety,
but as the squadron was now ready to sail, he regretted
the delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave the boys?&rdquo; asked the principal
of the courier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
&ldquo;At Apalst&ouml;,&rdquo; replied the guide, whose name was
Poulsen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you belong there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I live in Christiania. I went down there
with a young gentleman last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blacklock, sir; a young English gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! did you? And where is Mr. Blacklock
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left him at Apalst&ouml; with a party of young gentlemen
who were dressed like the people here; and
he sent me back with this letter,&rdquo; replied Poulsen,
who proceeded to explain that Clyde had engaged
him as courier for Christiansand, but had changed his
mind when he met the party belonging to the ship,
and had concluded to return to Christiania with them.</p>

<p>This was precisely what he had been told to say by
the young Briton, and probably he believed that it was
a correct statement. The principal saw no reason to
doubt the truth of it, for Clyde must be satisfied that
his mother was in Christiania by this time, and would
naturally wish to join her. Anxious to console Mrs.
Blacklock, Mr. Lowington called for a boat, and hastened
on shore to see her. He found her, her daughter,
and Paul Kendall and lady, in the reading-room at the
Victoria&mdash;a unique apartment, with a fountain in the
centre, a glass gallery over the court-yard, and lighted
with many-colored lamps. The principal communicated
the intelligence he had received of her son to
Mrs. Blacklock, whose face lighted up at the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have heard from the absentees, Mr.
Lowington,&rdquo; said Paul Kendall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes; they are on their way to Christiania, and
Sanford says they will arrive to-morrow, at farthest;
but they may be delayed,&rdquo; replied the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one need worry about them if they are safe
and well,&rdquo; added Paul, glancing at Clyde&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are safe and well, but I intended to sail for
Gottenburg to-morrow morning. I have almost concluded
to do so, and leave some one to accompany the
boys to Gottenburg in the steamer. I do not like to
delay the whole fleet for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would take a long time to beat out of the fjord
against a head wind,&rdquo; added Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the wind is fair to-morrow morning, I shall
sail, whether they arrive or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A steamer leaves for Gottenburg on Saturday
morning, and she may arrive as soon as your ship,&rdquo;
added Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true. I think I will leave Peaks to look
out for the absentees. Are you sure the steamer
goes on Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; here is the time table,&rdquo; replied Paul,
producing a paper he had obtained at Mr. Bennett&#8217;s.
&ldquo;Dampskibet Kronprindsesse Louise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s Norwegian, Paul. Can you read it?&rdquo;
laughed Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little. &lsquo;Hver L&ouml;verday;&rsquo; that means on Saturday;
&lsquo;at 6 fm.,&rsquo; which is early in the morning. She
arrives at Gottenburg about midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will answer our purpose very well. We
shall get under way early in the morning, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go on board of the yacht to-night, sir;
but you need not wait for me, for I think I can catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
you if you should get two or three hours the start of
me. I haven&#8217;t used my balloon jib yet, and am rather
anxious to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not wait for you, then, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a long conversation with Mrs. Blacklock, in
which he assured her again that nothing but firmness
on her part could save her son from ruin, the principal
left the hotel, and returned to the ship. In the evening
Mr. and Mrs. Kendall went on board of the Grace.
On the following morning, the wind being a little
north of west, the signal for sailing was displayed on
board of the Young America, and at six o&#8217;clock the
fleet were under way. The weather was beautiful,
and the fresh breeze enabled all the vessels to log
eight knots an hour, which brought them fairly into
the Skager Rack early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we are off the coast of Sweden now,&rdquo;
said Norwood, as he glanced at the distant hills on
the left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pilot said Frederikshald was in this direction,&rdquo;
replied Captain Lincoln, pointing to the shore.
&ldquo;It is at the head of a small fjord, and is near the
line between Norway and Sweden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles XII. was killed there&mdash;wasn&#8217;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the place. The fortress of Frederiksteen is
there, on a perpendicular rock four hundred feet high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we went nearer to the Swedish coast,&rdquo;
added Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see enough of it before we leave the
Baltic,&rdquo; said Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably we shall not care to see it after we have
been looking at it a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
&ldquo;According to the chart, this part of the coast is
fringed with islands, but they don&#8217;t look so bare and
desolate as those of Norway. I had an idea that
everything on this side of the ocean was entirely different
from what we see on our side,&rdquo; added the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just my idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&#8217;t so. It is almost the same thing here
as the coast of Maine. The shore here is hilly, and
through the glass it looks as though it was covered
with pine forests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect to see something different before we
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the Baltic; for I fancy most of the southern
coast looks like that of our Middle and Southern
States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up here, even the houses look just as they do at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe we shall find it so in Denmark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As there was little to be seen, the regular routine
of the squadron was followed, and those who were in
the steerage, attending to their recitations, did not feel
that they were losing anything. Later in the day, the
wind was light, and the vessels made very little progress,
though the course brought them nearer to the
coast, where on the port bow appeared a high promontory,
extending far out into the sea. The wind died
out entirely just before sunset, and the sails hung
motionless from the spars; for there was no swell to
make them thrash about, as at sea. It was utter
silence, and it was hard to believe that very ugly
storms often made sad havoc in this channel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
When the sun rose the next morning it brought
with it a light breeze from the west, and the fleet
again skimmed merrily along over the water. Its
course was near the town of Marstrand, a noted
Swedish watering-place, situated on an island. Soon
after, pilots were taken, and the vessels stood into the
harbor of Gottenburg, which is formed by the mouth
of G&ouml;ta River. Along the sides of the channel were
posts set in the water, for the convenience of vessels
hauling in or out of the harbor. The fleet came to
anchor in a convenient part of the port, and those on
board proceeded to take a leisurely survey of the city.
The portion of the town nearest to them was built on
low, flat land, and they could see the entrances of various
canals. Farther back was a series of rugged
hills, which were covered with pleasant residences
and beautiful gardens. After dinner the students
were mustered on deck, to listen to a few particulars
in regard to the city, though it was understood that
the general lecture on Sweden would be reserved until
the arrival of the squadron at Stockholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What city is this?&rdquo; asked Mr. Mapps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gottenburg,&rdquo; replied a hundred of the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is plain English. What do the Swedes call
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;G-&ouml;-t-e-b-o-r-g,&rdquo; answered Captain Lincoln, spelling
the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better call on Professor Badois to
pronounce it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&#257;t-a-borg,&rdquo; said the instructor in languages, repeating
the pronunciation several times, which, however,
cannot be very accurately expressed with English
characters. &ldquo;And the river here is Ya-tah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
&ldquo;The French call the city <em>Gothembourg</em>. It is five
miles from the sea, and is connected with Stockholm
by the G&ouml;ta Canal, which is a wonderful piece of
engineering. Steamboats ply regularly between Gottenburg
and the capital through this canal, the voyage
occupying three or four days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to make a trip up this canal as far as the
Wenern Lake, with the students,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>A cheer greeted this announcement, and then the
professor described the canal minutely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The principal street of Gottenburg,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;is on the canal, extending through the centre of the
city. There are no remarkable buildings, however,
for the city is a commercial place. It was founded by
Gustavus Adolphus, and, like many other cities of the
north, being built of wood, it has several times been
nearly destroyed by fire. The buildings now are
mostly of stone, or of brick covered with plaster. The
environs of the city, as you may see from the ship, are
very pleasant. Now a word about the money of
Sweden. The government has adopted a decimal
system, of which the unit is the <em>riksdaler</em>, containing
one hundred <em>&ouml;re</em>. The currency in circulation is
almost entirely paper, though no bills smaller than
one riksdaler are issued. The silver coins in use are
the half and the quarter riksdaler, and the ten-&ouml;re
piece; the latter being a very small coin. On the
coppers, the value in &ouml;re is marked. A riksdaler is
worth about twenty-seven cents of our money. Sweden
is a cheap country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The signal was made for embarking in the boats,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and in a few moments the Gottenburgers, as well as
the people on board of the foreign vessels in the harbor,
were astonished by the evolutions of the squadron.
The students landed, and dividing into parties,
explored the city. Their first care was to examine
the canal, and the various craft that floated upon it;
but the latter, consisting mainly of schooners, were not
different from those they saw at home. They visited
the exchange, the cathedral, the residence of the governor
of the province, and other principal edifices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Scott?&rdquo; asked Laybold, after
they had walked till they were tired out, and it was
nearly time to go to the landing-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tired and hungry,&rdquo; replied the wag. &ldquo;I wonder
if these Swedishers have anything to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably they do; here&#8217;s a place which looks like
a restaurant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I hadn&#8217;t tasted food for four
months. Let&#8217;s go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered the store, which was near the <em>Bourse</em>.
A neatly-dressed waiter bowed to them, and Scott
intimated that they wanted a lunch. The man who
understood English, conducted them to a table, on
which a variety of eatables was displayed, some of
which had a familiar look, and others were utterly
new and strange. The waiter filled a couple of wine-glasses
from a decanter containing a light-colored
fluid, and placed them before the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo; asked Scott, glancing suspiciously
at the wine-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Finkel</em>,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; that&#8217;s what I thought it was,&rdquo; replied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Scott, who had never heard of the stuff before. &ldquo;Is it
strong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the waiter, shaking his head with
a laugh. &ldquo;Everybody drinks it in Sweden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must, Laybold, for we are somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scott raised the glass. The fluid had the odor of
anise-seed, and was not at all disagreeable. The
taste, too, was rather pleasant at first, and Scott
drank it off. Laybold followed his example. We
must do them the justice to say that neither of them
knew what &ldquo;finkel&rdquo; was. Something like strangulation
followed the swallowing of the fluid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s not bad,&rdquo; said Scott, trying to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not bad, Scott; but what are you crying
about?&rdquo; replied the other, when he recovered the use
of his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to think of an old aunt of mine, who
died and left me all her money,&rdquo; added Scott, wiping
his eyes. &ldquo;But you needn&#8217;t cry; she didn&#8217;t leave any
of the money to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I generally eat victuals,&rdquo; replied Scott, picking up
a slice of bread on which was laid a very thin slice of
smoked salmon. &ldquo;That&#8217;s not bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter passed to Laybold a small plate of sandwiches,
filled with a kind of fish-spawn, black and
shining. The student took a huge bite of one of them,
but a moment elapsed before he realized the taste of
the interior of the sandwich; then, with the ugliest
face a boy could assume, he rushed to the door, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
violently ejected the contents of his mouth into the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded the waiter, struggling
to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What abominably nasty stuff!&rdquo; exclaimed Laybold.
&ldquo;It&#8217;s just like fish slime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you like it, Laybold?&rdquo; asked Scott, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like it? I don&#8217;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody in Sweden eats it,&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter with it? Is it like defunct
cat?&rdquo; asked Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More like defunct fish. Try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, my lad,&rdquo; added Scott, taking a liberal bite
of one of the sandwiches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; inquired Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First rate; that&#8217;s the diet for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to say you like that stuff, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proof of the pudding is the eating of the bag.
I do like it, even better than &lsquo;finkel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe it. No one with a Christian stomach
could eat such stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You judge by your own experience. I say it is
good. Yours isn&#8217;t a Christian stomach, and that&#8217;s the
reason you don&#8217;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a heathen, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heathen enough to know what&#8217;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some more finkel, sir?&rdquo; suggested the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more finkel for me,&rdquo; replied Scott, whose head
was beginning to whirl like a top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better take some more,&rdquo; laughed Laybold, who
was in the same condition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can&#8217;t stop to take any more; I&#8217;m hungry,&rdquo;
replied Scott, who continued to devour the various
viands on the table, till his companion&#8217;s patience was
exhausted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Scott, we shall be late at the landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&#8217;t go home till morning,&rdquo; chanted the
boozy student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go now;&rdquo; and Laybold stood up, and tried
to walk to the door&mdash;a feat which he accomplished
with no little difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be in a hurry, my boy. Come and take
some finkel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want any finkel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come and pay the bill. I shall clean out
this concern if I stay any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much, waiter?&rdquo; stammered Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One riksdaler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheap enough. I should have been broken if they
charged by the pound for what I ate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so,&rdquo; added Laybold, as he gave the waiter
an English sovereign, and received his change in
paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my boy, we&#8217;ll go to sea again,&rdquo; said Scott,
as he staggered towards the door. &ldquo;See here, Laybold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; snarled the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell you something, if you won&#8217;t say anything
about it to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t tell the principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we&#8217;re drunk,&rdquo; added Scott, with a
tipsy grin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, my boy; I don&#8217;t know a bob-stay from a
bowling hitch. And you are as drunk as I am,
Laybold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I am about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I know what you are about. You are
making a fool of yourself. Hold on a minute,&rdquo; added
Scott, as he seated himself on a bench before a shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for Joseph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just what I want. I&#8217;m not going to present
myself before the principal in this condition&mdash;not
if I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laybold, finding that it was not convenient to stand,
seated himself by the side of his companion. Presently
they discovered a party of officers on their way
to the boats, and they staggered into a lane to escape
observation. The two students, utterly vanquished by
&ldquo;finkel,&rdquo; did not appear at the landing, and the boats
left without them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>ON THE WAY TO THE RJUKANFOS.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;What may the Rjukanfos be?&rdquo; asked Clyde
Blacklock, after his courier had started on
his return to Christiania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&#8217;s a big thing,&rdquo; replied Sanford. &ldquo;You can
bet high on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless I can; but is it a mountain, a river, or
a lake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Pon my word, I don&#8217;t know. Here, Norway!&rdquo;
he shouted to Ole, who was with the rest of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m here, Mr. Coxswain,&rdquo; replied the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the Rjukanfos? You told me we ought
to go there; but I&#8217;ll be hanged if I know whether it&#8217;s
a lake or a river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither a lake nor a river,&rdquo; replied Ole. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a
big waterfall. <em>Fos</em>, on the end of a word, always
makes a waterfall of it. There&#8217;s another, the V&ouml;ringfos;
but that&#8217;s too far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know; but it&#8217;s a long distance,&rdquo; added
Ole. &ldquo;All the other fellows think we are going to
Christiania in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but Stockwell and Rodman,&rdquo; answered Sanford,
who had told Ole about the new recruit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
&ldquo;So you are going to play it upon them&mdash;are
you?&rdquo; laughed Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little. We don&#8217;t want to leave Norway
without seeing something of the country, and the rest
of the fellows won&#8217;t go. So we are going to take them
along with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent! That will be a magnificent joke,&rdquo; exclaimed
Clyde. &ldquo;I&#8217;m with you. I suppose you all
ran away from the ship when you found the tyranny
was too much for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no! We didn&#8217;t run away. We wouldn&#8217;t do
that. Somehow, by an accident, our boat was stove,
and we were carried off by a steamer. Then we
couldn&#8217;t get back to Christiansand before the ship
sailed, and we were obliged to come across the country
to Christiania, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; replied Clyde, knowingly. &ldquo;But you
don&#8217;t mean to go back to the ship&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly we do,&rdquo; protested Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are bigger spoonies than I thought you
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we are afraid the ship will be gone before we
can reach Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you are afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&#8217;t cry if you found she had gone&mdash;would
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps we should not cry, for we think we
ought to be manly, and not be babies; but, of course,
we should feel very bad about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly we should; for if we were caught running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
away, staying away longer than is necessary, or
anything of that sort, our liberty would be stopped,
and we should not be allowed to go on shore with the
rest of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a deep one, Mr. Coxswain,&rdquo; added Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no! I&#8217;m only a simple-minded young man,
that always strives to do his duty as well as he knows
how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you think it is your duty to visit the&mdash;what-ye-call-it?&mdash;the
waterfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see it is just as near to go that way as the
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&#8217;t, we shall not know the fact till
after we have been there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I understand you perfectly, Mr. Coxswain;
but I don&#8217;t intend to return to the ship under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do as you please, but if we should
happen to miss the ship, why, we shall be obliged
to travel till we find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; laughed Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&#8217;t understand me that we mean to run
away, or to keep away from the ship any longer than
is absolutely necessary; for we are all good boys, and
always mean to obey our officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mean to do any such thing. After I hear
that the ship has left Christiania, I shall go there, find
my mother, and travel where I please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the party started on their journey,
and by the middle of the afternoon arrived at a
station between Lysthus and Tinoset, where the road
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to the Rjukanfos branched off from that to the capital.
They were compelled to wait an hour here for a
change of horses. Rogues rarely believe that they are
suspected, and Sanford was confident that his companions,
with the exception of Rodman and Stockwell,
had no idea of his intentions. Burchmore had
not failed to notice the repeated conferences between
those who were plotting the mischief. He was not
quite satisfied with the delay which had enabled the
party to catch that solitary salmon at Apalst&ouml;. He
was one of the first to enter the station-house where
the carioles stopped. On the table he found &ldquo;The
Hand-book of Norway,&rdquo; which contained a large
map. He was anxious to possess this book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hvor</em>?&rdquo; said he, using a word he had learned
of Ole, which meant &ldquo;how much,&rdquo; at the same time
holding up the book, and exhibiting his money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tre</em>,&rdquo; replied the woman in the room; by which
he understood her to mean three marks, for at the
same time she laughingly held up three fingers.</p>

<p>Burchmore paid the money, and put the book into
his pocket. Retreating behind the stable with Churchill,
who rode in the cariole with him, he produced
the volume, and spread out the map. Without much
difficulty he found the road by which the party had
come. Everything was right so far, and he was
satisfied that they should arrive at Kongsberg that
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make out what&#8217;s up, Burchmore?&rdquo; asked
Churchill, with whom the former had discussed his
doubts and fears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; everything is right. Here we are, at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
branching off of these two roads,&rdquo; replied Burchmore,
indicating the locality with the point of his knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Sanford is up to something. He, and Ole,
and Stockwell are whispering together half the time.
Perhaps they mean to leave us somewhere on the
road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can, if they like,&rdquo; added Burchmore. &ldquo;I
am cashier, you know. Each fellow has paid me
seven pounds, which I have changed into species and
marks. No other one has any Norwegian money, or,
at least, not more than a specie or two. They won&#8217;t
leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&#8217;t make anything by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sanford runs with that English fellow, who
seems to be a little fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a hard one,&rdquo; added Churchill, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them go it; I can keep the run of them now,&rdquo;
said Burchmore, as he folded up the map, and put the
Hand-book in his pocket. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t say anything about
this book, Churchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where we are now, and I think I shall
know better than to wait a whole day for horses again.
That was a sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so at the time, but I didn&#8217;t want to
make a fuss. I changed a sovereign for Ole yesterday,
and I believe Sanford has bought him up. Never
mind; we take the right hand road here, and as long
as we keep moving I haven&#8217;t a word to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In less than an hour the horses were ready, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
procession of carioles moved off. Ole and Sanford
led the way, and turned to the left, instead of the
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s wrong,&rdquo; said Burchmore, very much excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do they mean by going this way?&rdquo; added
Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t care; I only know it is
the wrong way. Hallo!&rdquo; he shouted to Sanford,
and stopped his pony, which compelled three others
behind him to stop also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; called Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going the wrong way,&rdquo; replied the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, this is right; come along;&rdquo; and the coxswain
started his team again.</p>

<p>But Burchmore refused to follow him, and continued
to block the way against those behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the way!&rdquo; cried Clyde, who was in the
rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not the right way to Kongsberg,&rdquo; said
Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the way, or I&#8217;ll smash you!&rdquo; added the
imperious Briton.</p>

<p>The cashier was a peaceable young gentleman, and
turned his horse out of the road. The cariole of
Sanford was now out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you go ahead?&rdquo; demanded Tinckner.
&ldquo;How do you know it is the wrong road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain of it. Those fellows are up to some
trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a portion of the procession did not follow its
leader, Sanford and his companions turned back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter, Burchmore? Why don&#8217;t you
come along?&rdquo; cried the coxswain, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not the right road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it, Ole?&rdquo; added the coxswain, turning to his
companion in the cariole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it isn&#8217;t,&rdquo; protested the cashier, vehemently.
&ldquo;You are up to some trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trick?&rdquo; asked Sanford, mildly, as he put
on his look of injured innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what; but I know this is not the
right road to Kongsberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said anything about Kongsberg? We intend
to go by the shortest way. Don&#8217;t we, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure we do,&rdquo; replied the ready waif. &ldquo;We
are not going way round by Kongsberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&#8217;t bluff me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t want to bluff you. Go whichever way you
like; and the one who gets to Christiania first is the
best fellow. That&#8217;s all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford turned his pony, and drove off again, followed
by Clyde, Stockwell, and Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know this isn&#8217;t the right way?&rdquo; inquired
Tinckner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied the cashier, jumping out
of the cariole, and taking the Hand-book from his
pocket.</p>

<p>The others soon joined him, and exhibiting the map,
he explained his position to his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s another road to Kongsberg,&rdquo; said Summers,
indicating its direction on the map. &ldquo;They
may be going that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; added Burchmore, puzzled by this
discovery. &ldquo;It is farther that way than by Lysthus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much; there&#8217;s hardly any difference. I&#8217;m in
favor of following Sanford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So were nearly all of them, and the cashier finally
yielded. The tourists resumed their seats, and soon
overtook the coxswain, who had evidently expected to
be followed. Burchmore was annoyed by the discovery
he had made, but as the pony attached to the cariole
slowly climbed the hills, he studied the map and
the text of the book he had bought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&#8217;t go much farther on this tack,&rdquo; said he,
as he folded up his map.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s to prevent us from keeping on to the north
pole?&rdquo; asked Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is almost night, in the first place, and in the
second, we shall come to a lake in the course of an
hour, where we must take boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe anything is wrong about the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you? Then what are we doing up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; we shall soon come to that other
road, and then we shall know whether Sanford means
to go to Kongsberg or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has stopped ahead of us. He is waiting for
us to come up,&rdquo; added Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and there is the road which turns off to the
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t he go ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford and those who had arrived with him left
the carioles, and gathered at the junction of the two
roads. Burchmore followed their example.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter? What are you stopping here
for?&rdquo; demanded Clyde Blacklock, rather imperiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the fellows think we are going to play
them a trick,&rdquo; said Sanford, with his sweet and innocent
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who thinks so?&rdquo; asked Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burchmore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is Burchmore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s my name,&rdquo; replied the cashier, rather indifferently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the fellow that wants to break up the
party?&rdquo; blustered Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m the fellow that wants to go to
Christiania. We ought to have kept to the right at
the last station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I insist on going this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t object; you can go whichever way you
please,&rdquo; added the cashier, very gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we mean to keep the party together; and
we might as well fight it out here as in any other
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde threw off his overcoat, as though he intended
to give a literal demonstration of his remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t consider you as one of the party,&rdquo; added
Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not. You don&#8217;t belong to our ship, and
I don&#8217;t pay your bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter for that. If you are not willing to go
the way the rest of us wish to go, I&#8217;ll pound you till
you are willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Old England; we don&#8217;t want anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of that sort. Burchmore is a first-rate fellow,&rdquo; interposed
the politic Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You leave this fellow to me; I&#8217;ll take care of him.
I can whip him out of his boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall stick to my boots for the present,&rdquo; replied
Burchmore, who did not seem to be intimidated by
the sharp conduct of the Briton. &ldquo;I am willing to
listen to reason, but I shall not be bullied into anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by bullied? Do you call me
a bully?&rdquo; foamed Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can draw your own inferences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call me a bully?&rdquo; demanded Clyde, doubling
his fists, and walking up to the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of this,&rdquo; said Sanford, stepping between
the Briton and his intended victim. &ldquo;We shall not
allow anybody to lick Burchmore, for he is a good
fellow, and always means right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t allow any fellow to call me a bully,&rdquo; replied
Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&#8217;t call you a bully. He only said he would
not be bullied into anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter if it is, Old England. You volunteered
to pound him if he wouldn&#8217;t go with us; and it strikes
me that this is something like bullying,&rdquo; added the
coxswain, with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall thrash him for his impudence, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&#8217;t exactly civil to tell a fellow you will pound
him if he won&#8217;t go with us; and who shall thrash you
for your impudence, eh, Old England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
&ldquo;We shall allow no fight on this question, my gentle
Britisher. If you should happen to hit Burchmore,
I have no doubt he would wallop you soundly
for your impudence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him do it,&rdquo; cried Clyde, pulling
off his coat, and throwing himself into the attitude of
the pugilist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&#8217;t, Albion; and if you would you
can&#8217;t have that pleasure. There will be no fight to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there will,&rdquo; shouted Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much;&rdquo; and Sanford, Rodman, and Stockwell
placed themselves between Burchmore and Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry up, Great Britain!&rdquo; added Wilde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a point to settle here,&rdquo; continued Sanford,
taking no further notice of the belligerent Briton. &ldquo;The
right hand road goes to Kongsberg; but there is no
hotel in that direction where we could sleep to-night.
I propose, therefore, that we go on to&mdash;what&#8217;s the
name of the place, Norway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tinoset,&rdquo; replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Tinoset, where there is a big hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; asked Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two or three miles. Then to-morrow we
can go on to Kongsberg, unless you prefer to go a
better way. I&#8217;m always ready to do just what the rest
of the fellows say,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>The matter was discussed in all its bearings, and
even Burchmore thought it better to sleep at Tinoset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Sanford, as he moved off towards
his cariole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; interposed Clyde, who still stood with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
his coat off. &ldquo;I haven&#8217;t settled my affair with this
spoony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burchmore and Churchill walked leisurely towards
their vehicle, while Rodman and Stockwell covered
the retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you thrash him, you thrash the whole of us,
Great Britain,&rdquo; said Rodman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a way is that?&rdquo; demanded the disgusted
Briton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&#8217;t have any fight over this matter,&rdquo; added
Stockwell. &ldquo;Jump in, and let us be off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ll settle it when we get to that place,&rdquo; replied
Clyde, seeing that this opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>The procession resumed its journey, and in half an
hour arrived at Tinoset. As it was early in the season,
the hotel was not crowded, as it sometimes is.
The town is at the foot of Lake Tins, upon which the
little steamer Rjukan made three trips a week each
way. The boat was to depart the next morning for
Orn&aelig;s, which is only a few miles from the Rjukanfos.
Sanford declared that the most direct route to Christiania
was by steamer through this lake, and then by
cariole the rest of the journey. Ole, of course, backed
up all he said, and most of the boys wished to go that
way. For some reason or other, Burchmore kept still,
though he did not assent to the coxswain&#8217;s plan, and
the question was still open when the tourists were
called to supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole, I want to see you alone,&rdquo; said the cashier,
after the meal was finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some money for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
&ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burchmore led the way to the lake, where they
found a retired place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What money have you for me?&rdquo; demanded the
astonished Norwegian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did Sanford give you for humbugging
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For playing this trick on us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coxswain gave you a sovereign for fooling us.
I&#8217;ll give you five species, which is more than a sovereign,
if you do what I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Ole, promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, where are you taking us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the cashier, producing his
book. &ldquo;I know all about it. You ought to have gone
to Lysthus, instead of taking the left hand road. We
are two Norwegian miles out of our way now. Sanford
has paid you a sovereign to lead us to some
place he wishes to visit. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only do what&#8217;s right,&rdquo; protested Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! I know better! The story that no horses
could be had at Apalst&ouml; was a humbug. I&#8217;ll give you
five species if you will do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole looked complacent, and held out his hand for
the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t pay till the work is done; but my word is
as good as my bond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waif had an &ldquo;itching palm,&rdquo; and, after considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
discussion, the terms of payment were
settled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where are we going?&rdquo; asked the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Rjukanfos. It is a big waterfall, with
high mountains&mdash;one of the finest places in Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; but we are not going there,&rdquo; added
Burchmore, decidedly. &ldquo;You will engage the carioles
for to-morrow morning, and we must be in
Kongsberg by noon, and near Christiania by night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanford will kill me,&rdquo; replied Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won&#8217;t; we will take care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can manage it, first rate. I will tell Sanford
that we can go up quicker on the other side of the
lake, and then cross over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him what you please, but my plan must be
carried out,&rdquo; answered Burchmore, who, perhaps, believed
that he should be justified in fighting the coxswain
with his own weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are; I&#8217;ve been looking for you,&rdquo; said
Clyde, presenting himself sooner than he was wanted.
&ldquo;You thought you would keep out of my way&mdash;did
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not given that subject any attention,&rdquo; replied
Burchmore, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have; you sneaked off here to keep out
of my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied Burchmore, who began
to walk slowly towards the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t escape me this time,&rdquo; added Clyde,
placing himself in front of the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to escape you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have; you are a Yankee coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps I am; but I&#8217;m not afraid of a British
bully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call me a bully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most distinctly I do, and I can prove my words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde was rather startled by this exhibition of
pluck, which he had not expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call me a bully&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&#8217;ll settle it here. Off with your coat,&rdquo;
blustered Clyde, as he divested himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never fight if I can help it; but I always defend
myself,&rdquo; replied Burchmore, resuming his walk towards
the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to run away?&rdquo; demanded Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I mean to walk very leisurely back to the
station-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&#8217;t!&rdquo; said the Briton, again placing
himself before the cashier.</p>

<p>Ole, who did not care, under the circumstances, to
be seen with Burchmore by any one of the party, had
disappeared by this time; but meeting Sanford near
the lake, he had informed him what Clyde was doing.
The coxswain hastened to the spot, with Stockwell
and two or three others. But they were a little too
late; for Clyde, feeling that he had gone too far to
recede with honor, had struck Burchmore. When
Sanford and the rest of the party reached the place,
the belligerent Briton lay on the ground, where, after
a sharp set-to and a black eye, he had been thrown
by his cool opponent. He picked himself up, and was
preparing for another onslaught, when the coxswain
stepped between the combatants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
&ldquo;Enough of that, Albion,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Clyde made a rush towards Burchmore, but the
others interfered, and held him back. In vain he
struggled in his wrath, but the stout coxswain and his
companions threw him upon the ground, and held
him there till his anger had in a measure subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be off, Burchmore,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;We will
take care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of him,&rdquo; replied the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are not; but clear out, and let us
have peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is afraid of me!&rdquo; roared Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Great Britain! He would have mauled
you to death if we hadn&#8217;t interfered. He can whip
his weight in wildcats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burchmore walked away, and soon disappeared
beyond the houses. Clyde foamed in his wrath for a
while, but finally consented to be pacified, promising,
very faithfully, to whip the cashier the next time he
caught him alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you do it, Albion. You never will see
your mother again if you attempt it. Wait a few
days, and then, if you insist upon it, we will let Burchmore
thrash you all you want,&rdquo; replied Sanford, as
they walked back to the station-house.</p>

<p>Clyde had a bad-looking eye, and perhaps believed
that he had had a narrow escape; but he still maintained
his credit as a bully. At the hotel, the question
of the route for the next day came up. Burchmore
insisted upon going to Christiania by the way of
Kongsberg, and Sanford, who had consulted Ole
again, assented. The waif had assured him that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
could reach the Rjukanfos quicker and better by the
road than by the lake.</p>

<p>The next morning the carioles were ready, and the
tourists renewed their journey, and went back on the
road by which they had come, till they came to that
which led to Kongsberg. The &ldquo;forbud&rdquo; had been
duly forwarded, and there were no delays or interruptions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s the lake?&rdquo; asked Sanford, when they
had been riding about two hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, the road don&#8217;t go near the lake, till we get to
the place where we cross,&rdquo; replied Ole, who was
carrying out in good faith the arrangement he had
made with the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall we cross the lake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a steamer which goes at seven o&#8217;clock in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the unsuspecting Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall come to a large town at noon; and we
musn&#8217;t stop a minute there, or those fellows will find
where they are. We can tell them it is Kongsberg,
you know,&rdquo; added the wily waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; laughed Sanford; &ldquo;we&#8217;ll tell them it
is Kongsberg, and they won&#8217;t know the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think they will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At noon, agreeably to the promise of Ole, the travellers
arrived at the large town, where they were
obliged to change horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Kongsberg, Burchmore,&rdquo; said the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it, really? or are you playing some trick upon
us?&rdquo; replied the cashier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
&ldquo;&#8217;Pon my word this is Kongsberg. Isn&#8217;t it, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; answered the waif, winking slyly
to Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Sanford; if you are satisfied, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is Kongsberg. I have been here before,&rdquo;
added Clyde, wishing to give his testimony in
carrying out the deception.</p>

<p>It was quite true that he had been in Kongsberg, but
Ole took care that he should not go to the part of the
town he had visited before. The road looked familiar
to him; but as he rode alone, he had no opportunity to
state the fact to others. Before night the party arrived
at Drammen, where a regular line of steamers runs to
Christiania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the lake&mdash;is it?&rdquo; said Sanford, pointing
to the Drammen River, which, below the town, is
nearly two miles wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Burchmore say? Does he know where
he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet; I shall tell him this is Drammen, and he
will believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! and we will all stick to it that this is Drammen,&rdquo;
added Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose we should meet some one here who
knows about the ship? This is a large town&mdash;bigger
than that other which we called Kongsberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom can we meet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hate to have any one tell the principal
that we have been to the Rjukanfos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the officers may come up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
&ldquo;We must keep out of sight, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others thought this would be good policy in a large
town. As they were fatigued, they retired early, and
did not come down the next morning till it was nearly
time to leave in the steamer. They all went on board,
and were soon moving down the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going across the lake, Ole?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a kind of arm of the lake, about a dozen
miles long. We shall come to the lake in a couple of
hours,&rdquo; replied the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; but it must be a very large lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest in Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a couple of hours the steamer arrived at Holmsbo,
on the Christiania Fjord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can see that this is a large lake,&rdquo; said
Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are we?&rdquo; demanded Burchmore. &ldquo;Is
this the way to Christiania?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is,&rdquo; replied Sanford, who did not yet
recognize the fjord, though the truth could not
be much longer concealed. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you know this
water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Christiania Fjord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it, really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; you can bet your life upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another hour the steamer was fairly in the fjord;
Sanford and Stockwell began to rub their eyes; for
the scenery looked strangely familiar, though they
could not fully identify anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What place is that ahead?&rdquo; asked Sanford. &ldquo;I
am almost sure I have seen it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That place?&rdquo; added the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is Christiania Fjord, that must be Dr&ouml;bak.
I have a map here,&rdquo; said Burchmore, producing his
book, and displaying the map. &ldquo;Here we are; there&#8217;s
Holmsbo, and this must be Dr&ouml;bak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand it,&rdquo; replied the perplexed coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you? Why, I think it is as clear as mud,&rdquo;
laughed Burchmore. &ldquo;We shall be in Christiania in
a couple of hours. I thought you were playing some
trick upon us, Sanford; but I see now that you were
all right. There&#8217;s the captain; he speaks English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What town is that, captain?&rdquo; asked the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr&ouml;bak; we shall be in Christiania in about two
hours,&rdquo; answered the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s Ole?&rdquo; demanded the coxswain, much
excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; said Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. Where&#8217;s Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waif evidently considered discretion the better
part of valor, for he could not be found; and the
coxswain and those in his confidence realized that
they had been &ldquo;sold&rdquo; in their own coin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE BOATSWAIN AND THE BRITON.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s Ole? I don&#8217;t understand it,&rdquo; repeated
Sanford, after he had made another
ineffectual search for the missing waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been sold, instead of selling those fellows,&rdquo;
added Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; and I should rather like to know how
it was done. Ole has sold us out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your Rjukanfos?&rdquo; demanded Clyde Blacklock,
who had been looking for some one upon whom
to pour out his wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; answered Sanford, indifferently, for
he did not particularly enjoy the airs of the Briton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean by bringing me here?&rdquo;
added Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t bring you here. You came of your own
free will and accord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&#8217;t; you said we were going to the
waterfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought so ourselves; but we have been deceived.
Ole has sold out and made fools of us. You
are no worse off than the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom did he sell out?&rdquo; asked Clyde, appeased
when he learned that he was not the only sufferer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t understand it at all. We
have been cheated out of the Rjukanfos, and brought
to Christiania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo; inquired
Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&#8217;t do anything about it. I suppose we
shall be on board of the ship in an hour or two, telling
the principal how hard we tried to be here before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&#8217;m not going back to Christiania,&rdquo; protested
Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see how you can help yourself. This boat
don&#8217;t stop again till she arrives there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not go to the ship again, at any rate,&rdquo; added
Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as you like about that; it isn&#8217;t our business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde was much disturbed by the situation. As he
always regarded himself as the central figure of the
group, he began to suspect that the apparent miscarriage
of the plan was a trick to lure him back to the
ship; but Sanford seemed to be honest, and to be
entirely discomfited by the discovery. Burchmore and
Churchill were highly elated at the success attending
their scheme, which had, indeed, exceeded their expectations;
but they were as much mystified by the
disappearance of Ole as the victims of the trick.
Being unable to speak the language, they could not
inquire for the absentee; but they made a very diligent
search for him. They were more successful than
Sanford&#8217;s party had been, for, in going forward, they
heard some high words in the quarters of the steamer&#8217;s
crew, in the forecastle. Listening for a moment,
they heard the voice of Ole, who appeared to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
concealed himself in that part of the vessel, and was
properly regarded as an intruder by the rightful occupants
thereof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out here, Ole,&rdquo; shouted Burchmore. &ldquo;We
want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole turned from the Norwegian sailors, who were
scolding at him for taking possession of their quarters,
to his friends and allies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s Sanford?&rdquo; he asked, rather timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;ll kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! We will take care of you against any
odds,&rdquo; said the cashier, laughing heartily at the fears
of the waif. &ldquo;They have only just ascertained where
they are. Come up, Ole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus assured, the young Norwegian climbed up
the ladder, much to the satisfaction of the sailors.
Burchmore was too well pleased with the trick he had
played upon the conspirators to confine the knowledge
of it to Churchill and himself, and had explained
it to all who were not actually in the confidence of the
coxswain. A majority of the party were thus arrayed
on his side, though two or three of them would as
readily have chosen the other side. The cashier was
evidently the safer leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanford and that Englishman will pound me for
the trick,&rdquo; repeated Ole, as he glanced at the quarter-deck,
where his victims were considering the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they won&#8217;t; we are able and willing to protect
you,&rdquo; replied Burchmore. &ldquo;Come, we will go
aft, and hear what they have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
The cashier led the way, and the waif reluctantly
followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you wanted to see Ole,&rdquo; said Burchmore,
who could hardly look sober, he was so pleased with
the result of his operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I did wish to see him,&rdquo; answered Sanford,
rather coldly. &ldquo;I will see him some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I thought you wanted him now,&rdquo; laughed
Burchmore. &ldquo;I am satisfied that this is really Christiania
Fjord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added the coxswain, with a sickly
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were quite right, too, in saying that large
place was Drammen,&rdquo; chuckled Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither were you mistaken in regard to Kongsberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find that I was not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you remember the Irishman&#8217;s turtle,
that swallowed his own head, Sanford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mean to say that you swallowed your own
head; but you found it just where you didn&#8217;t expect
to find it. Isn&#8217;t that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to talk the matter over with Ole
by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it now. I know all about it. You and Ole
arranged the first part of our journey, including the
day&#8217;s fishing we had at Apalst&ouml;; and Ole and I arranged
the last part of it. It is an even thing now,
and if you won&#8217;t complain of the last part, I won&#8217;t
say a word about the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you! Well, you gave Ole a sovereign to
arrange things for you in the beginning, and I gave
him five species to arrange them for me afterwards.
You can&#8217;t complain of a fellow, who sells himself at
all, for making as much money as he can. Ole only
did that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sold us out,&rdquo; growled Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he did; if you buy a man, you mustn&#8217;t
grumble when he does a second time what you encouraged
him to do in the first instance. But you
were going to take us off to the Rjukanfos, fifty or
sixty miles out of our way, without our knowledge or
consent. I smelt a mice, and turned the tables,&rdquo;
laughed the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you cheated me,&rdquo; interposed Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had nothing whatever to do with you,&rdquo; answered
Burchmore, mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You led me here when I wanted to go another
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went where you pleased, so far as I was concerned.
I never invited you to come with me, or even
consented to your doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say the place we came to yesterday was
Kongsberg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, and so it was. But I think it was Sanford
who first proclaimed the fact, and I cheerfully assented
to its correctness,&rdquo; chuckled Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you deceived me, and I&#8217;ll have it out with
you,&rdquo; continued Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you please about that; but you had better
let that black eye bleach out before you begin again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
&ldquo;I can whip you!&rdquo; blustered Clyde. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll meet you anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you. If we meet for any such purpose
as you suggest, it will be by accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Great Britain; you needn&#8217;t make another
row,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going to whip this fellow for what he has
done, and for calling me a bully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a bully,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so,&rdquo; exclaimed Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can lick the whole of us, if you insist
upon it,&rdquo; continued the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will,&rdquo; retorted Clyde, shaking his head
fiercely. &ldquo;You have got me into a pretty scrape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in the same boat as the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The squadron isn&#8217;t here,&rdquo; shouted Wilde; for the
steamer had by this time arrived within sight of the
harbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can the ship have sailed?&rdquo; asked Sanford, after
the party had satisfied themselves that not one of the
vessels of the little fleet was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has,&rdquo; replied Burchmore. &ldquo;To-day
is Friday, and she didn&#8217;t intend to lie here all
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Clyde. &ldquo;That makes everything
all right for me. I&#8217;m satisfied now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, he was so delighted with the discovery that
the ship had sailed, as to be even willing to forego the
pleasure of thrashing his companions. The steamer
went up to the wharf, and the party landed. Sanford
and his friends appeared to be willing to take a reasonable
view of the situation, and to accept it without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
grumbling, satisfied that they had been beaten with
their own weapons. They were not sorry that the
squadron had departed, for this circumstance gave
them a new respite from the discipline of the ship,
and enabled them to prolong &ldquo;the trip without running
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; asked Clyde,
as they landed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall follow the ship, and try to join her,&rdquo;
replied Sanford. &ldquo;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been trying to
do ever since we left Christiansand&mdash;isn&#8217;t it, Burchmore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is,&rdquo; replied the cashier; &ldquo;though we
were detained one day at Apalst&ouml;, and narrowly
escaped being carried by accident to the Rjukanfos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to blow upon us, Burch?&rdquo; demanded
Stockwell, warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I? Did you ever know me to do such a
thing?&rdquo; added Burchmore, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; replied the whole party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think it was just the thing to cheat some
of us as you did; but I believe we are about even on
that now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we all want to get back to the ship as
soon as possible,&rdquo; added Sanford, rubbing his chin,
significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. She has gone to Gottenburg, and all
we have to do is to follow her,&rdquo; said Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you want to go there by the way of the
Cape of Good Hope, Sanford, it will be better to have
the matter understood so in the beginning,&rdquo; added
Burchmore. &ldquo;I, for one, don&#8217;t like to be bamboozled.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
&ldquo;I won&#8217;t try it on again,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then; if you do, you may fetch up at
Cape Horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall we go now?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Victoria Hotel. It is the best in the
place,&rdquo; replied Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the very reason why we don&#8217;t want to go
there. We are not made of money, and we may run
out before we are able, with our utmost exertions, to
reach the ship,&rdquo; added the cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my mother is there,&rdquo; continued Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to your mother, Great Britain, if you like.
We shall stay at some cheap hotel,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>Clyde protested in vain against this arrangement,
and the Americans, with the aid of Ole, found a small
hotel, suited to their views of economy. The Briton
went with them; but when they were installed in their
new quarters, he left them to find his mother, at the
Victoria. After dinner, the coxswain and his party
wandered all over the city. At the Castle of Agerhaus,
they saw an English steamer receiving freight.
They ascertained that she was bound to Gottenburg,
and would sail at seven o&#8217;clock that evening. They
immediately decided, as they had seen enough of
Christiania, to take passage in her. The arrangement
was speedily made, and they went on board, without
troubling themselves to inform Clyde of what they
intended to do. When the sun went down that evening
the party were far down the fjord.</p>

<p>Sanford had ascertained that the ship sailed early on
Thursday morning, and the steamer on which they
had taken passage could not arrive at Gottenburg till
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
nearly noon on Saturday. It was understood that the
squadron would remain but a short time at this port,
and it was possible that it would have departed for
Copenhagen before the steamer arrived. He hoped
this would prove to be the case; but he studied a plan
by which the excursion of the party could be prolonged,
if the hope should not be realized. He did
not wish to return to the ship, because he thought it
was pleasanter to travel without the restraints of discipline.
Perhaps most of his party sympathized with
him, and thought they could have a better time by
themselves. Sanford desired to inform Clyde of the
intention of the party to leave in the English steamer,
and to take him along with them; but his companions
overruled him unanimously, for they were too glad to
get rid of an impudent, overbearing, and conceited
puppy, as he had proved himself to be. The coxswain
had no better opinion of him than his friends;
but as Clyde was a runaway, according to his own
confession, it might smooth their own way, in returning
to their duty, if they could deliver him up to the
principal. He was even willing to resort to strategy
to accomplish this end; but Clyde was so disagreeable
that he was saved from this trap.</p>

<p>The ship had gone, and every vessel of the squadron
had departed with her. Clyde felt that all his
trials were ended, and he had nothing more to fear
from the big boatswain. He walked confidently to
the Victoria Hotel, where he was sure to find his
mother. He had even arranged in his mind the reproaches
with which he intended to greet her for delivering
him over to the savage discipline of the Young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
America, as he regarded it, and as, doubtless, it was for
evil-doers. He passed into the passage-way which led
to the court-yard. As he entered the office on the
right to inquire for Mrs. Blacklock, he encountered
Peaks, who no sooner saw him than he laid violent
hands upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; shouted Clyde, struggling to escape
from the grasp of his powerful antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my beauty,&rdquo; replied the boatswain, as he
dragged his victim into his own room, which was near
the office. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve been looking for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see my mother,&rdquo; growled Clyde, when
he had exhausted his strength in the fruitless struggle
to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you do; babies always want to see their
mothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then behave like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peaks deposited him on a chair, and permitted him
to recover his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo; demanded Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is safe and well, and you needn&#8217;t bother your
head to know anything more about her,&rdquo; answered
Peaks. &ldquo;She has turned over a new leaf, so far as
you are concerned, youngster, and is going to have us
make a man of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t I see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you must, my hearty; but I don&#8217;t think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
she wants to see you till you are a decent young gentleman.
She told me to be sure and put you on board
of the ship, and I&#8217;m going to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sailed for Gottenburg yesterday morning; but
we shall find her in good time,&rdquo; replied Peaks, taking
a bundle from the bureau, which contained the young
Briton&#8217;s uniform. &ldquo;Now, my bantam, you don&#8217;t look
like a gentleman in that rig you&#8217;ve got on. Here&#8217;s
your gear; put it on, and look like a man again,
whether you are one or not. Those long togs don&#8217;t
become you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatswain unfolded the uniform of Clyde, which
he had left in his chamber when he leaped out of the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not going to put on those clothes,&rdquo; protested
the unhappy youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&#8217;m going to put them on for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll cry murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you cry anything, I shall put a dirty handkerchief
in your mouth. Look here, my chicken; don&#8217;t
you know that you are making a fool of yourself? You
mean to strain your own timbers for nothing. You&#8217;ll
put this rig on anyhow, and it depends on yourself
whether you will do it with or without a broken
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde looked at the clothes and then at the brawny
boatswain. It was foolish to resist, and he yielded to
the force of circumstances. He put on the ship&#8217;s uniform,
and threw himself into a chair to await the further
pleasure of his tyrant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now you look like a respectable young gentleman,
my lad,&rdquo; said Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; demanded
Clyde, in a surly tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going to keep my eye on you every moment
of the time till you are on board of the ship again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see my mother before I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&#8217;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde relapsed into silence. He had never before
been subjected to such unheard-of tyranny. It was
useless to resist, and the future looked as dark as the
present. Probably his mother was in the hotel, but
he was not permitted even to see her. Though the
boatswain seemed to have it all his own way, he was
not at all satisfied with the situation. Mrs. Blacklock
and her daughter had gone to ride, but in the course
of an hour or two they would return. The waiters
would inform her that Clyde had arrived, and she
would insist on seeing him. Though she had fully
given up the control of him to the ship, the weakness
of the mother might induce her to change her mind.
Peaks only desired to discharge the duty with which
he had been intrusted. The crew of the second cutter
had not yet arrived, and he could not depart with his
prisoner before they came. He was perplexed; but
being a man of expedients, he decided upon his course
in a short time. It was absolutely necessary to seek
another hotel, where the dangerous proximity of Mrs.
Blacklock might be avoided. The boatswain rang
his bell, and sent for the <em>commissionnaire</em> whom he
had employed while prosecuting his search for the
runaway. When this man came, he ordered a carriage,
and paid his bill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now, youngster, we are going to take a ride,&rdquo;
said Peaks to his victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s my affair. If you make a row in the street,
I shall just hand you over to the police, who will lock
you up in that stone castle over there. You must understand
that you are a deserter from your ship, and
will be treated so, if you don&#8217;t behave like a man.
Now come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a deserter from his ship! The boatswain certainly
had the weather-gage of him, and the idea of
being thrown into prison was absolutely startling to
Clyde. He had no doubt the savage boatswain would
do all he threatened, and, almost for the first time in
his life, he felt no inclination to bully. He stepped
quietly into the carriage with Peaks and the <em>commissionnaire</em>.
The driver was directed to convey the party
to the landing-place. The steamer would sail the next
morning; but unless the absent crew of the cutter arrived
before that time, he could not go in her. Remaining
in Christiania, he feared to encounter Mrs.
Blacklock, for the honest tar dreaded a lady&#8217;s power
more than the whole battery of a ship of the line. He
was fully resolved, if he passed through fire and water
in doing it, to discharge the duty intrusted to him by
the principal. The lady was in the city, and the problem
was to keep his charge out of sight of her during
the rest of his stay. He might meet her; some one at
the hotel might, and probably would, inform her of the
arrival of Clyde.</p>

<p>After deliberating for some time, he directed his
<em>commissionnaire</em> to procure a boat, in which he embarked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
with his prisoner and interpreter. By his order
the two oarsmen pulled over to the hotel which
was located so picturesquely on the island. Taking a
room, he ordered dinner for his little party, and contrived
to pass away the afternoon till sunset, when he
returned to the city. His man, at his request, conducted
him to an obscure hotel, which happened to
be the one which Sanford and his friends had just
left, to depart by the English steamer. The landlord
recognized the uniform which Clyde wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had more of the young gentleman here,&rdquo; said
he, in broken English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More of them!&rdquo; exclaimed Peaks, interested in
the intelligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; more as ten of them,&rdquo; added the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arn&#8217;t they here now?&rdquo; asked Clyde, who had felt
a ray of hope when Peaks brought him to the hotel
where he had left his late companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All gone; no more here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have they gone?&rdquo; asked the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Gottenburg. They eat some dinner in my
hotel, and at seven o&#8217;clock they go in the steamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that steamer go out, but I didn&#8217;t think the
cutter&#8217;s crew were in her. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t know it
before,&rdquo; said Peaks, chagrined by this tardy discovery.
&ldquo;How many were there of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That couldn&#8217;t be; there were only nine of the
crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was more as ten, but one of them went
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went away,&rdquo; said Clyde.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
&ldquo;You! Were you with them?&rdquo; demanded Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t you say so before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t ask me; and as you were not remarkably
civil to me, I didn&#8217;t feel obliged to tell you the
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there were not ten of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ten,&rdquo; said Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were only nine when they left the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know there were ten with me. One of them
was a Norwegian, and a rascal; but he wore the same
uniform as the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole! Why, he&#8217;s the fellow we picked up out at
sea,&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished boatswain. &ldquo;Where
have they been all this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Clyde suddenly bethought himself that he was
altogether too communicative, considering the relations
that subsisted between himself and his great
enemy and persecutor, and he decided to answer no
more questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my hearty,&rdquo; laughed the boatswain,
when the Briton declined to answer. &ldquo;They are on
their way to the ship, and you will be very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peaks was cunning enough to detain his interpreter
so that he should not return to the Victoria and inform
Mrs. Blacklock where her son was. The way
was clear now, for he had no further responsibility in
regard to the cutter&#8217;s crew, and his spirits rose accordingly.
He sent his man to engage a &ldquo;h&uuml;tte,&rdquo; or state-room,
in the steamer, and then, at a late hour in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
evening, paid and discharged him. He compelled
Clyde to sleep in the same chamber with him, for it
contained three beds, and it is probable that the boatswain
kept one eye open during the night, for every
time the prisoner moved, his tyrant was on his feet.
The Kronprindsesse Louise sailed at six o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and Peaks and his victim were betimes on
board. The boatswain was a happy man when the
boat was clear of the wharf, and on her way to Gottenburg.
He flattered himself that he had managed
the affair very well indeed, for he was not above the
vanities of the flesh.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the Kronprindsesse arrived
at her destination. Peaks had kept one eye on Clyde
all the time, and brought him in safety to his journey&#8217;s
end. Late as was the hour, the first person he saw at
the landing was Mr. Blaine, the chief steward of the
ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Blaine,&rdquo; shouted the boatswain
when he identified his shipmate, and grasped his hand.
&ldquo;Shiver my timbers if I&#8217;m not rejoiced to see a man
that speaks plain English! Where&#8217;s the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sailed for Copenhagen this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you don&#8217;t say so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a fact. The students went up the canal as far
as the falls, and returned about dark. The squadron
got under way at once. I suppose you have the cutter&#8217;s
crew with you, Peaks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; arn&#8217;t they on board yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t seen them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they came down on an English steamer that
left Christiania last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
&ldquo;An English steamer came in this forenoon, but we
haven&#8217;t seen the cutter&#8217;s crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s strange. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if those fellows
were cutting up a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we lost two students yesterday, Scott and Laybold.
I suppose they ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a screw loose somewhere. These boys
have too much money,&rdquo; added Peaks. &ldquo;But what are
you going to do, and what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was left here to look out for Scott and Laybold,
and meet you when you came. Now, it seems that
about a dozen of the rascals are missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the Briton here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you, Peaks, I should go right on to Copenhagen
in this steamer, and you can report the facts
to the principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatswain decided to do this, while the head
steward remained to search for the absentees; and in
due time Peaks delivered his prisoner on board of the
ship in the harbor of Copenhagen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE MEETING OF THE ABSENTEES.</strong></p>


<p>Scott and Laybold, after imbibing a single glass
of &ldquo;finkel&rdquo; each, which proved to be more
than they could carry, retreated into a narrow lane, to
escape the observation of a party of officers who were
on their way to the landing. Neither of them had
any inclination for intoxicating drinks, and had taken
the stuff without knowing what it was. But they were
conscious that everything was not right with them.
They found it quite impossible to walk in a straight
line, and even the problem of standing up was not
demonstrated to the entire satisfaction of either of
them. Talking was not without its difficulties, for
their tongues seemed to be double their ordinary thickness,
and their lips and other organs of speech were
not as manageable as usual. For a time the effects
of the potent liquor increased upon them, and as they
had taken it in a hungry condition, they realized its
full power.</p>

<p>They staggered up the lane, conscious that they were
making a ridiculous figure, though the solemn Swedes
hardly smiled as they observed the effects of the national
beverage. They dreaded an encounter with any
of the officers, or others connected with the squadron;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
but in this unfrequented lane they were not likely to
meet any of their shipmates. As there is more power
in four legs than in two, however weak in detail they
may be, the tipsy students locked arms, and leaned on
each other, one attempting to counteract the obliquities
of the other. They wandered along without knowing
whither they were going, till they came to a small
public house, which had a bench in front of it for the
accommodation of the topers who frequented the bar-room.
By mutual consent, and without argument,
the unfortunate couple aimed for this seat as soon as
they saw it, for it promised a grateful respite from the
perils of locomotion. The &ldquo;finkel&rdquo; was now doing
its utmost upon them. Their heads were dizzy, and
everything was wofully uncertain; still they knew what
they were about, and had sense enough left to dread
the consequences of their indiscretion. After they had
seated themselves, they glanced at each other, as if
to ascertain the condition one of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay&mdash;bold,&rdquo; said Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old fellow,&rdquo; replied the other, with a desperate
attempt to stiffen his muscles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re zrunk,&rdquo; added Scott, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re very zrunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not zbad zyou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t zknow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation extended no further then, for
speech required an effort they were incapable of
making. Scott gaped violently, and seemed to be
sick; but his contortions ended in his falling asleep,
with his head tipped back against the wall. Laybold,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
more nice in the disposition of his helpless body,
stretched himself on the bench, and was soon lost to
all consciousness of the outer world. The publican
who kept the house came out and looked at the juvenile
tipplers. Doubtless he had seen too many drunken
sailors to misapprehend their condition. He understood
the matter perfectly, and being a thrifty Swede, he
was disposed to turn their condition to his own emolument.
He had sundry vacant chambers in his hotel,
whose revenues swelled the sum total of his annual
profits, and it hurt his feelings to have them remain
unoccupied. Besides, the air was chilly, and the
young strangers might take cold, and contract a severe
illness by such exposure. But whether he was a publican
or a Samaritan in his intentions, he decided to
remove the strangers to the rooms beneath his hospitable
roof. Summoning the porter to his aid, they
jointly bore Laybold to his apartment, and laid him on
the bed, which, in spite of the low character of the
house, was a model of Swedish neatness. When
Scott&#8217;s turn came, he offered some resistance to the
good intentions of the publican; but his head was too
thoroughly muddled for successful opposition. Between
the effects of sleep and &ldquo;finkel&rdquo; he could not
obtain a very clear idea of what was going on. He
was placed on another bed in the room with his shipmate.
They were both comfortably disposed on their
clean couches, the pillows nicely adjusted beneath
their heads, and their bodies covered with blankets.</p>

<p>The two students were very tired as well as very
tipsy, and their slumbers were deep and heavy. It
was after nine o&#8217;clock, though it was still light in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
chamber, and the young tars usually retired, when not
on watch, before this seemly hour. &ldquo;Finkel&rdquo; and
fatigue did the rest, and they slept, without rocking,
till long after the early sun broke into the windows of
their apartment. We have seen the effect of &ldquo;finkel&rdquo;
upon one unaccustomed to the use of liquor, and upon
boys of fifteen or sixteen it could not but be entirely
overpowering. It is a dangerous fluid, and is taken
by the Swedes at all times, being the first thing at
meals, and especially at the inevitable &ldquo;snack&rdquo; that
precedes a regular dinner. There is, doubtless, good
ground for the fear which has been expressed that the
people of Sweden are in danger of becoming &ldquo;a
nation of drunkards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scott was the first to open his eyes and come to
his senses. He raised himself in the bed, shook off
the blanket, and then jumped out upon the floor. He
did not comprehend the situation, and was unable, in
his own words, to &ldquo;figure up how he happened to be
in that room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laybold, ahoy!&rdquo; shouted he, after he had examined
the apartment, and mentally confessed his
inability to solve the problem. &ldquo;Laybold! All hands
on deck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried Laybold, springing
up, only half awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll be muzzled if I know what the matter is, but I
believe that the Norway god&mdash;what&#8217;s his name?&mdash;Odin,
came aboard the ship last night, and turned her
into a country tavern,&rdquo; replied Scott, going to the
window, and looking down into the lane below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came we here?&rdquo; asked Laybold, rubbing
his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s more than I know; but I think we have
been transplanted by the spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirits?&rdquo; gaped Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I believe they call them &lsquo;finkel.&rsquo; We were
tight last night, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember all about it now. I dreamed that
somebody lugged me in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t exactly dream it, for here we are.
We are in a pretty scrape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so,&rdquo; added Laybold, shaking his head.
&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t mean to run away, but that&#8217;s just what
we have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t run a great way; for, if I remember
rightly, running wasn&#8217;t our <em>forte</em> last evening. Who
runs may reel, if he can&#8217;t read, and I reckon we did
more reeling than running. But what&#8217;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, where are we? It&#8217;s no use to
lay out a course till we know the ship&#8217;s position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were utterly unable to determine this question.
Each of them had a tolerably vivid recollection
of their unfortunate condition on the preceding evening,
and even that he had been carried by a couple of
men; but they had no idea of time or locality. They
washed themselves at the sink in the room, combed
their hair with their pocket-combs, and looked then as
though nothing had happened. Their heads were a
little light, but they did not absolutely ache, and
they realized but a small portion of the after effects of
a regular &ldquo;spree.&rdquo; Having made their simple toilet,
they decided to explore the premises, and make their
way back to the ship. Leaving the chamber, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
descended a flight of steps, and, in the hall below, encountered
the Samaritan landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>God morgon</em>,&rdquo; said the latter, with a jolly smile
on his face; and it was probable that he had taken his
morning dose of &ldquo;finkel.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Hur star det till?</em>&rdquo;
(How are you?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nix,&rdquo; replied Scott, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are English,&rdquo; added the landlord, a large
portion of whose customers were foreign sailors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to see you, too, if you can tell us how
we happen to be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much &lsquo;finkel,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed the publican, as he
proceeded to explain the situation, and to enlarge upon
the fatherly interest which had induced him to take
them in for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my hearty. I see you can keep a hotel,&rdquo;
added Scott. &ldquo;How much have we to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two rigsdalers; but you want some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, for one,&rdquo; replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Laybold. &ldquo;We only had a little
lunch last night, and that &lsquo;finkel&rsquo; spoiled my appetite&mdash;or
the fish spawn. I don&#8217;t know which.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About five o&#8217;clock they sat down to breakfast, which
consisted of a great variety of little things, such as
the small fishes, herrings, smoked salmon, sausages.
The coffee was magnificent, as it generally is in
Sweden, even on board of steamers, where, in our
own country, it is least expected to be good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said Scott, taking up half a great
brown biscuit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s Swedish bread. We bake it once in six
months,&rdquo; replied the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; added Scott, as he tasted the article.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Graham bread, I suppose,&rdquo; said Laybold,
as he took a slice of the coarse brown bread. &ldquo;Bah!
it&#8217;s sour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It always is; and both the students rejected it,
though they ate a hearty meal of white bread, herring,
salmon, and sausage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how much?&rdquo; asked Scott, when they were
ready to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One rigsdaler and fifty &ouml;re each&mdash;three rigsdalers
in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheap enough,&rdquo; said Scott. &ldquo;Two lodgings and
two breakfasts for eighty-one cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students walked through the lane in which
they had made their devious way the night before, to
the main street on the canal. At the landing-place
there were no boats belonging to the squadron, and
everything looked exceedingly quiet on board of the
ship. Seating themselves on the pier, with their legs
hanging over the water, they decided to wait till a
boat came to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall catch it for this,&rdquo; said Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more liberty for a month at least,&rdquo; said Scott,
shrugging his shoulders after his fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair. We didn&#8217;t mean to get
drunk, and didn&#8217;t know what &lsquo;finkel&rsquo; was,&rdquo; added
Laybold. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t half like to go on board again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I; but I suppose we must face the music,&rdquo;
answered Scott, dubiously. &ldquo;I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t go
on board while we were boozy. The fellows would
have laughed at us for a year, if we had.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; and Lowington would have put us in
the brig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t exactly like to explain the reason why we
didn&#8217;t go on board last night; I always was a bashful
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t go with the others,&rdquo; said a man,
coming up to them at this moment, and speaking in
broken English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What others? Where?&rdquo; replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other students. They took the steamer up
the canal at two o&#8217;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Scott. &ldquo;We have lost G&ouml;ta
Canal and the falls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will return to-night by the railroad from
Wenersberg,&rdquo; added the man, who was an agent of
the canal steamers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Laybold, as the man
walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know that it is too bad. Our leave would
have been stopped if we had gone on board,&rdquo; laughed
Scott, who generally took the most cheerful view of
any disagreeable subject. &ldquo;Why can&#8217;t we go on our
own hook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that idea,&rdquo; added Laybold.</p>

<p>But inquiring of the agent, they learned that the
canal steamers left only at two o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a railroad, or the fellows couldn&#8217;t come
back that way,&rdquo; suggested Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; you have more wisdom than a Duxbury
clam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ascertained that a train left Gottenburg at
noon, by which they could reach Wenersberg the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
day. They knew nothing of the plan of the principal,
which included a special train from the canal to
the main line of railway; but they desired to see more
of the interior of Sweden, and they were confident
they should see the excursionists either at Wenersberg
or on the way. It suited them better to make a trip
even for a few hours, than to wander about a city
which they had already exhausted. But they were
obliged to wait some time for the train, and, after a
couple of hours of &ldquo;heavy loafing&rdquo; about the streets,
they returned to the pier. An English steamer had
just arrived, and a boat was landing her passengers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are those fellows?&rdquo; said Laybold, pointing
to the steamer&#8217;s boat. &ldquo;They wear the ship&#8217;s uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right; they do, and they came from that steamer,&rdquo;
replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s Sanford! I should know him a mile off.
They are the second cutters, or I am a Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right again,&rdquo; added Scott, as the passengers
landed.</p>

<p>The steamer was the one in which Sanford and his
companions had taken passage at Christiania the evening
before. The absentees, &ldquo;on a cruise without
running away,&rdquo; were sorry to see the ship at anchor
in the harbor, for some of them had hoped to be too
late for her. When they landed, the first persons they
encountered were Scott and Laybold, who gave them
a very cordial greeting. Each party had a story to
tell of its own adventures, and Scott knew Sanford
and his associates too well to think it necessary to
conceal from them the fact that he and Laybold had
been the sad victims of &ldquo;finkel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
&ldquo;But why don&#8217;t you go on board?&rdquo; asked Burchmore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the use? All the fellows have gone up to
Wobblewopkins, or some other place, to see the falls,
and take an inside view of Sweden,&rdquo; replied Scott.
&ldquo;We intend to go and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you go with us?&rdquo; added Laybold.</p>

<p>The intentions of the two were explained to the
others, and they all decided to join the party. Sanford
was not without a hope that something would
occur to prolong the &ldquo;independent trip without running
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you off for stamps?&rdquo; asked Burchmore
of the two who were by this arrangement added to
his party, for which he had thus far done the financiering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a little Swedish money, and some sovereigns,&rdquo;
replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how many sovereigns? We may be prevented
from joining the ship for a few days, and we
want to know where we are in money matters,&rdquo; interposed
Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have enough to buy out one or two of these
one-horse kingdoms, like Denmark and Sweden. I
have twenty sovereigns, and Laybold has about a
thousand,&rdquo; answered Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No I haven&#8217;t,&rdquo; protested Laybold, laughing at the
extravagance of his friend. &ldquo;I have only twenty-five
sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a letter of credit for a thousand more; so it&#8217;s
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; knock off one cipher, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, seeing it&#8217;s you, I&#8217;ll knock off just one; but
not another to please any fellow, even if he were my
grandmother&#8217;s first cousin,&rdquo; added Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s some difference between a hundred and a
thousand pounds,&rdquo; suggested Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slight difference,&rdquo; said Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t expect any of us will live long enough to
spend a hundred pounds in this country, which is
about eighteen hundred of these tricks-bunker dollars,
to say nothing of a thousand. Why, we paid only
three bunkers for two lodgings and two breakfasts.
How&#8217;s a fellow ever to spend eighteen hundred bunkers?
For my part, I think I&#8217;m lucky in having less
than four hundred of the things to get rid of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you needn&#8217;t feel under the necessity of spending
all your money in this country,&rdquo; laughed the
cashier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father promised to send me some more; but I
hope he won&#8217;t do it till I get out of Sweden. If he
does I shall be ruined. Here&#8217;s poor Laybold, with a
letter of credit for a hundred pounds, besides twenty-five
in cash. I pity the poor fellow. It wouldn&#8217;t be
so bad in London, where it costs a fellow from ten to
twenty shillings a day to breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I shall be able to survive,&rdquo; added Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so; but you ought to hear him talk about
his bankers. Topsails and topping-lifts! His bankers!
Messrs. Pitchers Brothers &amp; Co.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Bowles Brothers &amp; Co,&rdquo; interposed Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all the same thing; there isn&#8217;t much difference
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
between bowls and pitchers. One breaks as easy as
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my bankers don&#8217;t break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His bankers! Do you hear that? Well, I don&#8217;t
believe they&#8217;ll break, for all my folks, when they travel
in Europe, carry the same letter of credit in their trousers
pocket. I had to write to my paternal parent all
last year, care of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co., 449 Strand,
Charing Cross, W. C. London, England. You see
I&#8217;ve learned my lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My letters from home come through the same
house,&rdquo; said Laybold, &ldquo;and so do those of fifty other
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the money matters,&rdquo; interposed Burchmore.
&ldquo;Shall I act for the crowd, as I did in Norway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me, yes; and I hope you&#8217;ll help Laybold out
on the big financial job he has on his hands,&rdquo; said
Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; added Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have settled up for the fellows on the Norway
trip. Now, each of you give me a couple of sovereigns,
which I will change into Swedish money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This arrangement was made to the satisfaction of
all, and the cashier went to an exchange office, where
he procured Swedish paper for the gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scott, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if the principal saved
you the trouble of spending your twenty pounds before
we go much farther,&rdquo; said Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall thank him with tears in my eyes if he
does,&rdquo; replied Scott, with a solemn look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe you will. When the ship came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
over before, every fellow had to give up his money,
and the purser doled it out to the fellows in shillings
or sixpences when they went ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure it was very kind of him to take so much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. Only think of poor Laybold,
with a letter of credit for a hundred pounds on his
hands! I&#8217;m thankful I haven&#8217;t the responsibility of
spending so much money on my conscience. I should
apply for admission to the first lunatic asylum, if I had
to spend so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I made up my mind not to give up
my money,&rdquo; said the coxswain. &ldquo;That rule made
plenty of rows on the other cruise, and I expect the
fellows on this cruise will be called upon to give up
their stamps very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to say we could get even with the
principal by spending it all before we go on board
again; but we are in Sweden, and it is quite impossible.
They won&#8217;t let you pay more than seventy-five
cents or a dollar for a day&#8217;s board in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went to a sailor&#8217;s boarding-house, Scott.
When you are at a first-class hotel, you will find that
they bleed you enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they do better than the landlord where we
staid last night; if they don&#8217;t I shall make money in
Sweden. Why, they wouldn&#8217;t even pick our pockets
when we were boozy on &lsquo;finkel.&rsquo; I&#8217;m sure they are a
great deal more accommodating at sailors&#8217; boarding-houses
in Boston and New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, be serious, Scott. Shall you give up your
money when you return to the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cheerfully, for there is no chance to get rid of it
in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will want some in Russia, where everything
is dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid my letter of credit will arrive by that
time, and I shall be burdened with new trials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old rule of the ship had not been enforced on
the present cruise, and the principal did not intend to
renew it until it was absolutely necessary. It had
caused much complaint among the wealthy parents
of the former students, while it had wonderfully improved
the discipline; but Mr. Lowington consented
to make the experiment of permitting every boy to
manage his own finances.</p>

<p>At noon the party took their places in a second-class
compartment of the carriage on the railway, and
started for Wenersberg. Ole spoke Swedish as well
as Norwegian, and acted as interpreter. Sanford
had made peace with the waif, who was now as popular
as ever with all the party. Each of them, in
turn, had tried to induce Ole to tell how he happened
to be in that boat at sea; but he still refused to explain.</p>

<p>The train moved off, and the tourists observed the
country through which it passed; but Scott could not
help grumbling because the fare was only about a dollar
and a quarter for fifty miles, declaring that he
should never be able to get rid of his twenty sovereigns
at this rate, and that he was threatened with a
letter of credit for a hundred more at St. Petersburg.
At Herrljunga, the junction of the branch to Wenersberg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and the main line, the guard insisted that the
tourists should leave the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;s this, Ole?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change for Wenersberg; but the train don&#8217;t start
till five o&#8217;clock. We must wait two hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what time does it get to Wenersberg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half past eight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a pretty go!&rdquo; exclaimed the coxswain.
&ldquo;You made a beautiful arrangement for this trip,
Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot get to Wenersberg till half past eight;
and of course that will be too late to join the ship&#8217;s
company there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&#8217;t necessary to join them there. We shall
meet them on the way, and go back with them. They
will be at this place some time this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did we come up here for?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, to get rid of four or five rix-bunkers;
and in the second, to see something of this part
of Sweden. We have done both, and ought to be
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I&#8217;m satisfied!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be; you have four and a half bunkers
less to spend. We will loaf about this place till
the principal comes with the crowd, and when he sees
what good boys we have been to look him up, and
see that he didn&#8217;t get lost, he&#8217;ll forgive Laybold and
me for drinking &lsquo;finkel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. What time does the train leave for
Gottenburg, Ole?&rdquo; added the coxswain, turning to the
interpreter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
&ldquo;Half past five,&rdquo; replied the waif.</p>

<p>No one took the trouble to examine the time-table
in the station-house, which, though in Swedish, was
perfectly intelligible so far as it related to hours and
towns.</p>

<p>The tourists decided to improve the time they were
obliged to wait by taking a walk about the country,
examining Swedish houses and investigating Swedish
agriculture. Doubtless this was a very interesting
amusement; but at quarter past five, the party returned
to the station. A long train was just departing
in the direction of Gottenburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What train&#8217;s that?&rdquo; demanded Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; replied Ole, with a look of alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inquire, then,&rdquo; added the excited coxswain.</p>

<p>The party hastened into the little station. It was
the regular train for Gottenburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how&#8217;s that?&rdquo; cried Sanford. &ldquo;You said it
left at half past five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I looked at the time-table in Gottenburg,
and it said half past five,&rdquo; replied Ole. &ldquo;Here is one,
and I will look again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better wait till morning before you look again,&rdquo;
said Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is; five&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all, Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure it was half past five in Gottenburg,&rdquo;
pleaded Ole, whom the coxswain had privately requested
to make this blunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of chowder do you call this, son of
Odin?&rdquo; demanded Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has made a blunder; that&#8217;s all,&rdquo; laughed Burchmore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
who, though not in the confidence of the coxswain,
at once suspected the trick, and, to tell the
truth, was not sorry for the mistake.</p>

<p>The mishap was discussed for an hour, and poor
Ole was severely blamed, especially by Sanford, for
his carelessness; but he bore the censure with becoming
meekness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s to be done?&rdquo; inquired Scott, at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s another train at 8.56,&rdquo; replied Ole, pointing
to the time-table. &ldquo;We can return to Gottenburg
in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, Norway,&rdquo; added Scott.</p>

<p>They found a small hotel in the place, where they
obtained a supper, and at the time indicated returned
to Gottenburg, where they arrived at about one in the
morning. It was too late to go on board of the ship,
and they went directly to the little hotel in the lane,
where Scott and Laybold had passed the preceding
night. It was closed, but they easily roused the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have again come,&rdquo; said the good-natured
host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we have again come. It is too late to go on
board of the ship,&rdquo; replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ship have sail to-night to Copenhagen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen her sail,&rdquo; persisted the landlord. &ldquo;I
have make no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are dished!&rdquo; exclaimed Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young gentleman come down at seven o&#8217;clock,
and the ship have sail at nine o&#8217;clock. I know it so
well as I know how to speak the English.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
&ldquo;It must be so, then,&rdquo; laughed Scott; &ldquo;for you
have spoke the English more better as nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; continued Sanford, who
seemed to be positively distressed at the unfortunate
circumstance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? Go to bed, and go to sleep. What else can
we do? You are too big a boy to cry over your misfortunes,&rdquo;
replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t intend to cry; but I feel very bad about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry your tears,&rdquo; said Burchmore. &ldquo;We may
as well take a biscuit, turn in, and call it half a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when will there be a steamer to Copenhagen?&rdquo;
asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Najaden must go Monday afternoon,&rdquo; answered
the landlord, who, for some reason best known
to himself, did not deem it prudent to mention the
fact that the Kronprindsesse Louise would sail within
half an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; interposed Rodman. &ldquo;We
have been chasing the ship now for a week, and by
the time we get to Copenhagen she will be gone. I
move we go to Stockholm. We shall be sure to catch
her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Wilde.</p>

<p>The proposition was fully discussed, and when a
majority favored the movement, the others, among
whom was Sanford, yielded an apparently reluctant
assent. The Wadstena would start at two o&#8217;clock,
and there was not a moment to lose. The landlord
was astonished at the decision, and his hotel was not
filled that night, as he intended it should be. Just as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the canal steamer was starting, the young tourists
hurried on board, and were soon on their way to
Stockholm.</p>

<p>Not a quarter of a mile distant at this moment were
Peaks and his prisoner, and Blaine, the head steward,
who was on the lookout for them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THROUGH THE SOUND TO COPENHAGEN.</strong></p>


<p>Mr. Lowington was almost forced to the conclusion
that the experiment of permitting the
students to manage their own finances was a failure. If
it could be a success anywhere, it must be in the northern
countries, where none of the boys spoke the language,
and where the lighter intoxicants were not so common
as in the more southern portions of Europe. Though
he was not aware that any pupils had made an improper
use of their money, the non-arrival of the crew
of the second cutter, and the disappearance of Scott and
Laybold in Gottenburg, seemed to have some relation
to the condition of their funds. But he was willing to
carry the experiment as far as practicable, and to
restore the obnoxious rule only when it was absolutely
necessary to do so. Two thirds of the students could
be safely trusted to manage their money matters, and
it was not pleasant to restrain the whole for the benefit
of the minority.</p>

<p>After the boys had walked all over Gottenburg, they
were weary enough to retire at eight bells in the evening,
especially as they were to turn out at two o&#8217;clock
the next morning, for the trip up the G&ouml;ta Canal. At
the appointed time, the steamer came alongside the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
ship, where she took the excursionists on board, the
boats of the other vessels conveying their crews to the
Young America. As it was still dark, not a few of
the boys finished their nap in the little steamer. About
eight o&#8217;clock, she reached the long series of locks by
which the canal passes the Falls of Trollh&auml;tten, and
the excursionists walked for a couple of hours through
the beautiful scenery, and embarking again in the
steamer, arrived at Wenersberg, where they obtained
a view of the Wenern Lake, and proceeded by
special train to Herrljunga, and thence, by regular
train, to Gottenburg, where they arrived before eight
in the evening. The wind was fair, and the squadron
immediately sailed to the southward.</p>

<p>The principal was annoyed by the absence of not
less than a dozen of the students; but he had every
confidence in the zeal and discretion of Peaks, who
was to take charge of the cutter&#8217;s crew, and he left the
head steward at Gottenburg to find Scott and Laybold.
He feared that the success of these wanderers
would encourage others to follow their example, and
increased vigilance seemed to be necessary on the part
of the instructors. The next day was Sunday, and it
was doubly a season of rest. The breeze was fair, but
very light, so that the squadron made only about four
knots an hour; but on Monday morning she was fairly
in the Sound, which is about three miles in width.
On the left was the town of Helsingborg, in Sweden,
and on the right Kronberg Castle, with Elsinore, on a
kind of land-locked basin, behind it. The vessels
continued on their course, keeping within a short distance
of the shore, so that those on board could distinctly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
see the towns and villages. The houses were
neat, with red roofs, each one having its little garden.
There were plenty of groves and forests, and the trees
were oaks and beeches, instead of pines and firs which
the voyagers had seen in Norway and Sweden. The
country was flat, with nothing like a hill to be seen.</p>

<p>The breeze freshening, the squadron hastened its
pace, and in the middle of the forenoon the spires of
Copenhagen were in plain sight. Off in the water
were several detached forts, built on small islands.
The Young America led the way, and soon dropped
her anchor off the citadel of Frederikshavn, and near
the landing-place, where a crowd of small steamers
were lying at the wharf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been here before, Dr. Winstock?&rdquo;
asked Captain Lincoln, as he saw the surgeon examining
the aspect of the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; several years ago. I have been in every
country in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Copenhagen don&#8217;t look just as I expected it
would,&rdquo; added the commander. &ldquo;I thought it must
be a very old, black, and musty-looking place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see that it is not,&mdash;at least not from the
water; but you will find plenty of dismal and gloomy-looking
buildings in it. The fact is, Denmark is too
small a kingdom to support all the show and expense
of royalty: its palaces are too large and costly to be
retained as such, and many of them have been permitted
to fall into partial decay. But I will not anticipate
Mr. Mapps&#8217; lecture, for I see the signal is flying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She makes a tremendous display of forts and
guns,&rdquo; added Lincoln, glancing from the batteries of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Trekroner and Lynetten to the bristling guns of Frederikshavn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless it is a strong place, but the English
have twice captured the city. Here are the boats
from the other vessels. I suppose we shall go ashore
after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steerage was soon crowded with students, and
Mr. Mapps took his usual position at the foremast, on
which appeared the map of Denmark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In English this country is called Denmark,&rdquo; said
the professor; &ldquo;but it has this name in no other language.
The Danes call it <em>Danmark</em>, the adjective of
which is <em>Danske</em>; and the country is also called the
<em>Danske Stat</em>, or Danish States. In German it is
<em>D&auml;nemark</em>; in French, <em>Danemark</em>; in Italian, <em>Danimarca</em>.
It is bounded on the north by the Skager
Rack, or Sleeve; on the east by the Cattegat, the
Sound, and the Baltic Sea; on the south by the Duchy
of Schleswig and the Baltic; and on the west by the
North Sea. When this ship was in Europe before,
Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg belonged to Denmark;
but now they belong to Prussia, and Jutland is
all that remains of continental Denmark. This peninsula
has an area of nine thousand six hundred square
miles, or about the size of the State of New Hampshire.
With the several islands, the entire area of
Denmark is fourteen thousand five hundred square
miles. Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and
several small islands in the West Indies, belong to
her. The population is nearly one million eight hundred
thousand&mdash;about equal to that of Massachusetts
and New Hampshire united.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
&ldquo;The country is flat, or gently undulating, and the
highest hill is only five hundred and fifty feet high.
The soil is sandy on the peninsula, and not very fertile,
but very rich on some of the islands. It is indented
to a remarkable degree with bays and inlets,
and the whole interior is dotted with small lakes, usually
connected by a river, like a number of eggs on a
string. The Lim Fjord, which you see in the north,
formerly only extended to within a short distance of
the North Sea; but in 1825 a tempest broke through
the narrow neck of land, and opened a passage for
small vessels. These inland lakes are full of fish, and
salmon was once so plenty that householders were forbidden
by law to feed their servants with this food
more than once a week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two largest islands are F&uuml;nen and Seeland,
which are separated by the Great Belt, and the former
from the main land by the Little Belt. In winter
these are frozen over, as is the Sound in the severer
seasons, and have been crossed by armies engaged in
military operations. The country is well wooded, and
you will find plenty of large oaks and beeches. This
morning you passed Elsinore, where Shakespeare locates
Hamlet; but you cannot find where &lsquo;the morn
walks o&#8217;er the dew of yon high eastern hill,&rsquo; for there
are no hills there; nor &lsquo;the dreadful summit of the
cliff, that beetles o&#8217;er his base into the sea.&rsquo; It is a
flat region, with only a low cliff to border the sea;
certainly with no such tremendous steeps as the poet
describes. Besides, Hamlet lived and died in Jutland.
But Shakespeare used the poet&#8217;s license.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly all of Denmark lies between latitude fifty-five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and fifty-eight; but, though the thermometer sometimes
falls to twenty-two degrees below zero in winter,
the average temperature is mild. The climate does
not materially differ from the eastern coast of Massachusetts.
The air is so humid that the grass and trees
have a livelier green than the countries farther south,
and droughts are almost unknown. When France
and Germany are parched and dry, Denmark is fresh
and green. The people are engaged principally in
agriculture and commerce. The chief exports are
grain, cattle, and horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The government is a constitutional monarchy.
The king is assisted in the executive department by a
&lsquo;Royal Privy Council&rsquo; of seven ministers. The legislature
is called the Rigsdag, and consists of the Landsthing,
or upper house, and the Folkething, or lower
house. Of the former, twelve are nominated for life,
by the king, from the present or past members of the
lower house, and the remaining fifty-four are elected,
in four classes, by the largest tax-payers in country
districts, in towns, in cities, and by deputies representing
the ordinary voters. The members of the
lower house are chosen directly by the people. All
male citizens of twenty-five, except paupers, and servants
who are not householders, are voters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The established religion of the state is Lutheran,
and the king must be of this church. He nominates
the bishops, who have no political power, as in England.
They have the general supervision and management
of all the affairs of the church in the kingdom.
Although there are only about thirteen thousand non-Lutherans
in Denmark, entire religious toleration prevails,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and no man can be deprived of his civil and
political rights on account of his creed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free education is provided by the government for
all children whose parents cannot afford to pay for
tuition, and attendance at school, between the ages of
seven and fourteen, is compulsory. All the people,
therefore, are instructed in the elementary branches;
and, besides the University of Copenhagen, there is a
system of high and middle schools, available for the
children of merchants, mechanics, and the more prosperous
of the laboring classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every able-bodied man in Denmark, who has attained
the age of twenty-one, is liable to serve as a soldier
for eight years in the regular army, and eight more
in the army of the reserve. In preparation for this
duty, every man is enrolled, and required to drill for a
period of from four to six months, according to the
arm of the service in which he is placed; and those
who do not become proficient in this time are required
to drill for another and longer period. The kingdom
is divided into military districts, and all the soldiers
are required to drill from thirty to forty-five days
every year. The navy of Denmark consists of thirty-one
steamers of all classes, six of which are iron-clads,
carrying three hundred and twelve guns, and manned
by nine hundred men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little is known of the history of this country before
the eighth century, but the Cimbri occupied it before
the time of Christ. The Danes conquered portions of
England, and in the eleventh century, Canute, who introduced
Christianity into his realm, completed the
conquest. Norway was also included in his kingdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and under him and his successors, during the next two
hundred years, Denmark attained the summit of her
power and glory. Holstein, Lauenburg, and several
other of the northern provinces of Germany, and even
a portion of Prussia, were subjected to her sway.
Waldemar II., a successor of Canute, with his eldest
son, was daringly captured, while resting from the
fatigues of the chase, one evening, by Count Schwerin,
whom the king had provoked to wrath by some flagrant
injustice. This bold act of retaliation was carried
to a successful issue, and the king and his son
were transported by water to Castle Schwerin, in
Mecklenburg, where they were kept as prisoners for
three years&mdash;a most remarkable instance of retribution,
if we consider that Waldemar was the most powerful
sovereign of the north. By threats and bribes
his release was procured; but during his confinement
the conquered provinces had revolted, and the king
was unable to recover his lost possessions. Denmark
was thus reduced from her lofty position by the injustice
of her king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Towards the close of the fourteenth century, Margaret&mdash;the
Semiramis of the North&mdash;succeeded to the
thrones of Norway and Denmark, and added Sweden
to her dominions by conquest, in the compact of Calmar.
The Swedes, under Gustavus Vasa, established
their independence after the union had existed for
one hundred and twenty-five years. At the death of
the last of Margaret&#8217;s line, in 1439, the states of Denmark
elected the count of Oldenburg their king, who
reigned as Christian I. He was made duke of Schleswig
and count of Holstein, and thus the sovereign of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Denmark became the ruler of these duchies, about
which there has been so much trouble within the last
ten years, and which caused the war of 1866 between
Prussia and Austria. He was followed by his son
Hans, or John, whose heir was Christian II., deposed
in 1523. This prince was a tyrant, and was kept
a prisoner for twenty-seven years. His crown was
given to Frederick, Duke of Schleswig and Holstein,
in whose reign Sweden established her independence.
His son Christian III. succeeded him. In the great
wars which followed the Reformation, the kings of
Denmark took the Protestant side. In repeated conflicts
with the Swedes, Denmark lost much of her territory.
After Christian III. came Frederick II., and
then Christian IV., who was followed by Frederick
III., in whose reign the crown, which had been nominally
elective, was made hereditary in the Oldenburg
line. Under Christian V. the country was at peace;
but Frederick IV., who came after him, brought on a
war with Sweden by invading the territory of the
Duke of Holstein, an ally of the King of Sweden,
which continued till 1718. Under Christian VI. and
Frederick V. the country was at peace. Christian
VII. married the sister of George III. of England,
and was followed, in 1808, by Frederick VI., their son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1780, Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, under
the influence of France, established a new code of
maritime laws, which operated against the interests
of England. This action in convention was called
&lsquo;Armed Neutrality,&rsquo; and in 1800, during the reign
of Christian VII., its principles were revived, and a
new agreement was signed by Russia, Prussia, Denmark,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and Sweden. It declared that arms and ammunition
alone were contraband of war, that merchandise
of belligerents, except contraband of war, was to
be protected by a neutral flag, and that &lsquo;paper blockades&rsquo;
should be regarded as ineffectual. England immediately
laid an embargo on the vessels of the powers
signing it. In 1801, a British fleet under Sir Hyde
Parker, with Nelson as second in command, bombarded
Copenhagen. Again, in 1807, England, fearing
that Denmark would be compelled by Napoleon
to take part against her, bombarded Copenhagen, and
compelled the government to give up its entire fleet,
which was sent to England. This ended the armed
neutrality. At the final treaty of peace, in 1814, Norway
was ceded to Sweden, which, in return, gave to
Denmark Pomerania, and the Island of R&uuml;gen; but the
next year Pomerania was passed over to Prussia, in
exchange for the Duchy of Lauenburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick VI. reigned till 1839, when he was
followed by Christian VIII. The two Duchies of
Schleswig and Holstein were still subjects of dispute.
The king claimed them, but the people of
Holstein were German in sentiment, and objected
to the incorporation of their country in the Kingdom
of Denmark, to which the continued efforts of
the latter were directed. The Danish language
was required to be used to the exclusion of the German.
In 1848, Frederick VII. came to the throne,
and was more energetic in pushing his claims to the
duchies than some of his predecessors had been. The
people of Holstein, which was a member of the German
Confederation, were in a state of insurrection,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
when the King of Denmark virtually annexed both
duchies to his kingdom. War ensued, and continued
for three years. The interference of some of the great
powers restored peace, but left the question in dispute
unsettled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the question in dispute?&rdquo; asked Captain
Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will explain it, though there are so many complications
to it, that only a general view of the subject
can be given. For four hundred years the line of
Oldenburg has occupied the throne of Denmark.
Schleswig and Holstein were governed by the same
rulers, though each country was separately organized.
But the law of succession was different. In Denmark
a female could rule, while in the duchies the line was
limited to males. Frederick VII. had no children,
and it was seen that the direct line of the house of
Oldenburg would be extinct at his death. A treaty
made by the several powers interested gave the succession
to Prince Christian, whose wife was entitled
to the throne by right of her descent from Christian
III., who died in 1559; but she yielded her right to her
husband, who ascended the throne in 1863, as Christian
IX., and is the present king. At the death of
Frederick VII., the Duke of Augustenburg claimed
the duchies. Germany desired to separate Schleswig-Holstein
from Denmark. The German troops entered
Holstein, which was a member of the Confederation,
and entitled to its protection. Denmark refused to
yield her title to the duchies, and war ensued. The
Danes were overwhelmed, and repeatedly defeated.
England declined to assist Denmark, as had been expected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
by the latter, and Denmark was compelled to
renounce all her claims to Schleswig-Holstein and
Lauenburg, in favor of Prussia and Austria. The
main question in regard to the final disposition of the
duchies was left open for future adjustment, and Prussia
took temporary possession of Schleswig, and Austria
of Holstein. The Duke of Augustenburg was
permitted to remain in the latter, but forbidden to get
up any demonstration in aid of his own claims.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Austria favored the claim of the duke, while Prussia
denied it, and accused her then powerful rival of
encouraging revolutionary movements in Holstein dangerous
to the thrones of Europe. Then followed the
great war of 1866, which resulted in the utter humiliation
of Austria, and the annexation of all the disputed
territories to Prussia. Denmark, thus shorn of her territories
and her power, has become an insignificant kingdom.
With less than two million inhabitants, she supports
all the costly trappings of royalty, and keeps an
army and navy. The king has a civil list of nearly
three hundred thousand dollars, and the heir apparent
has an allowance exceeding the salary of the President
of the United States, while the entire revenue of the nation
is only about thirteen million dollars. Prince Frederick,
the king&#8217;s oldest son, who succeeds to the throne,
married the daughter of the King of Sweden and Norway.
The princess Alexandra, the oldest daughter,
is the wife of the Prince of Wales. Prince Wilhelm,
the second son, was elected King of Greece, under the
title of Georgios I. in 1863. The Princess Dagmar is
the wife of the Grand Duke Alexander, of Russia, heir
of the throne. By their connections two of the sons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
are, or will be, kings, one daughter Queen of England,
and another Empress of Russia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1348, the King of Denmark levied duties on
all vessels passing through the Sound, at the Fortress
of Kronberg, which were applied to the expenses of
the light-houses, and the protection of shipping from
pirates. The United States first objected to the payment
of this tax, and called the attention of the commercial
nations of Europe to the annoyance. All vessels
were obliged to anchor, and submit to vexatious
delays; but none doubted the right to levy the dues,
which had been formally regulated by treaties. Denmark
consented to abandon her claims on the payment
of about fifteen millions of dollars by the nations of
Europe, and about four hundred thousand on the part
of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor completed his lecture, and the students
separated. Most of them climbed into the rigging,
or seated themselves on the rail, where they
could see the city and the various objects of interest in
the harbor. The view shoreward from the ship was
very unsatisfactory, for the city, built on a dead level,
presented but little to challenge the attention of the
voyager. While they were observing the surroundings,
a shore boat approached the vessel, in which
were two persons wearing the uniform of the squadron.
One of them was a stout man, in whom the students
soon recognized Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who is that with him?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s one of the second cutter&#8217;s crew, I suppose,&rdquo;
replied De Forrest. &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t think, when I went
ashore with them, that I shouldn&#8217;t see any of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
again for so long a time. I wonder where the rest of
them are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s not one of the second cutters,&rdquo; added Judson.
&ldquo;It is the English fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peaks came alongside, and directed Clyde Blacklock
to mount the accommodation ladder, which he did
without making any objection. They had arrived the
day before. The prisoner seemed to have lost some
portion of his stubborn spirit. The boatswain followed
him to the deck, and touching his cap to the captain
and other officers on the quarter-deck, went aft, where
the principal was talking with the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come on board, sir,&rdquo; said the boatswain,
as he took off his cap and pointed to Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowington. &ldquo;I&#8217;m
glad to see you again, Clyde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Briton nodded his head with a jerk,
but made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Blaine, Peaks?&rdquo; asked the
principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I met him on the wharf night before
last at Gottenburg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are the crew of the second cutter? I
expected you to bring them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came back to Christiania on Friday, and
took the steamer for Gottenburg the same evening;
but Mr. Blaine had not seen them. Their steamer
arrived in the forenoon, and the ship did not sail till
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is something wrong about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left Mr. Blaine in Gottenburg. I suppose he
will find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Peaks reported in detail the result of his mission
on shore. So far as Clyde was concerned it was entirely
satisfactory; but the continued absence of the
second cutter&#8217;s crew was very annoying to the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Clyde?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lowington,
turning to the new student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel well enough,&rdquo; replied the runaway, roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you do. I hope you feel better than
when you left the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you were on board before, I neglected to
explain to you the consequences of leaving the ship
without permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&#8217;t have made any difference. I should
have gone just the same,&rdquo; answered Clyde, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The less trouble you make, the better it will be for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will; but I don&#8217;t intend to stay in this
ship a great while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend that you shall stay here; and since you
avow your purpose to run away again, I must see that
you are put in a safe place. Peaks, the brig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brig? What&#8217;s that?&rdquo; demanded Clyde, who
was very suspicious of the calm, unmoved tones of
the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my lad, and I will show you,&rdquo; replied
the boatswain.</p>

<p>The Briton knew by sad experience how useless it
was to contend against this tyrant, who, however, always
used him well when he behaved in a reasonable
manner. He followed the boatswain into the steerage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and the door of the brig, which was a small prison
formed of plank slats, set upright under the steps,
about three inches apart, was opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the brig, my boy,&rdquo; said Peaks. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a
regular institution on board a man-of-war; but this
one has not been opened for months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&#8217;s it for?&rdquo; asked Clyde, who even yet
did not seem to comprehend its use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk in, and I will make it all plain to you in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail in!&rdquo; shouted a student, who, with others, was
observing the treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On deck, sir!&rdquo; said the boatswain, sternly, to the
speaker. &ldquo;Report yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a principle in the discipline of the ship that
no person should say or do anything to irritate a student
undergoing punishment, and no one was permitted,
on such occasions, to take part on either side,
unless called upon by the officer or instructor to do so.
In ordinary cases no boy was required, or permitted,
to be a &ldquo;tell-tale,&rdquo; and all were expected to remain
neutral. The student who had spoken left the steerage,
and went on deck, before Clyde had time to
&ldquo;open upon him,&rdquo; as he intended to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step in, my lad,&rdquo; added Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the Briton, as he obeyed the
order, but not without a suspicion that he was to
step upon a red-hot gridiron, or be precipitated through
some opening in the deck into the dark depths beneath.</p>

<p>No such calamity happened to him, and he was
rather astonished to find that no harsher punishment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
was used for the flagrant offence he had committed.
He had pushed the boatswain overboard, and then
run away. Peaks had never manifested any resentment
towards him on account of his cowardly trick;
but he anticipated some severe discipline on board of
the ship. The boatswain closed and locked the door
of the brig, and then looked in at the prisoner through
the slats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you understand what the brig is for now?&rdquo;
asked Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have locked me in&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long am I to stay here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till you make up your mind not to run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&#8217;t a bad place, and I shall stay here till I
grow gray before I promise not to be off when I get
a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my hearty. Think of it a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To one who had expected some horrible punishment
for his misdemeanors, the brig seemed like very
mild discipline. Clyde seated himself on the stool in
his prison, and leisurely surveyed the surroundings.
He was an enterprising youth, and the bars of his
cage looked small and weak. At dinner time, the
meal was handed in to him, and he ate with an excellent
appetite. Soon after, he heard the call for all
hands, and then the waiter in the steerage told him
they had gone on shore to see the city. Everything
was quiet and still, and he devoted himself to a more
particular examination of the bars of the brig. They
were two inches thick, but the case looked hopeful.
Pursuing his investigations still farther, he found, under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the steps, a saw, a hammer, a chisel, and some
other tools, which Bitts, the carpenter, had placed
there a few days before, and forgotten to remove.
Clyde took up the saw; but just then, Peaks, with a
book in his hand, seated himself at a table near the
brig, and began to read.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>COPENHAGEN AND TIVOLI.</strong></p>


<p>All the boats of the squadron came into line, each
with the flag in the bow and stern. They pulled
along the water front of the city, around a couple of
Danish men-of-war, and of course created a sensation.
One by one the boats rowed up to the landing, and
the students went on shore, each crew securing its
cutter at the wharf, near the steps. The custom-house
officers were on the alert; but as no one had parcels
of any kind, the students were not detained. Mr. and
Mrs. Kendall landed, and as they intended to spend a
few days in the city, they had a couple of valises,
which the porters, who are always in waiting at all
the ports in Europe, conveyed into the custom-house.
The Toldbod, as this edifice is called by the Danes, is
surrounded by a high wall, which also encloses the
entire landing-place, so that none can visit the city
from the sea without passing through its gates.</p>

<p>One of the officers spoke English very well, and
evidently took pride in doing so, for he asked a great
many questions so pleasantly, that it was impossible
to explain his object in any other way. He wished to
know whether the travellers had any clothing they
had not worn, and whether Mrs. Kendall had any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
tobacco or liquor. She protested that she did not use
tobacco or liquor; and the actual examination of the
baggage was a mere form. The man was so polite,
that Paul at once concluded he was only practising his
English. A carriage was procured, and Dr. Winstock
and Captain Lincoln were invited to join the
party. The inquiring students deemed it a great privilege
to be permitted to go with the surgeon, for he
was a walking encyclop&aelig;dia of every city and country
in Europe. As Paul Kendall had been before, Captain
Lincoln was now, the favorite of the doctor, and
the little party were to see the city together.</p>

<p>The carriage went out at the gate, and passed into
Amaliegade. The houses were plain and substantial,
without much ornament. They were of brick, but
most of them were covered with stucco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s this?&rdquo; asked Paul, as the carriage entered
an open space, with an equestrian statue in the
centre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederiksplads,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;and that is
the statue of Frederik V., who came to the throne in
1746, and in whose reign this palace was erected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The place was an octagon, surrounded on all sides
by public buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the residence of the king on the left. On
the other side is the palace of the crown prince.
There is the foreign office, and on the other side lives
the queen dowager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not very elegant buildings,&rdquo; said Captain
Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; there are no very fine buildings in Copenhagen,
though the Exchange is a very curious structure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
and some are very large and unwieldy. There&#8217;s the
Casino,&rdquo; added the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s a casino?&rdquo; inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is a building for dancing, concerts, theatrical
performances, and similar amusements in the
winter season. Everything is cheap here, and the
price of admission to the Casino, where one joins the
dance or sees a play, is two or three marks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much is that? I haven&#8217;t looked up the
money yet,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rigsbank dollar is the unit, worth about fifty-four
cents of our money. It is divided into six marks,
of nine cents each, and a mark into sixteen skillings, of
about half a cent each. When the Italian opera is at
the Casino, the prices are only three or four marks.
This is Gothersgade,&rdquo; added Dr. Winstock, as the
carriage turned into another street. &ldquo;In plain English,
Gothic street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s another equestrian statue,&rdquo; added Captain
Lincoln, pointing to a large, irregular space, surrounded
by public buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The statue of Christian V. This is Kongens, or
King&#8217;s Square. There are the Academy of Arts, the
Royal Theatre, the Guard House, the New Market&mdash;none
of them very fine, as you can see for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage crossed this square, and came out at a
canal, on the other side of which was the vast palace
of Christiansborg. A short distance farther brought
the party to the Royal Hotel. The carriage stopped
at the door in the arch, and the two landlords, the
porter, the waiters, and the clerk, half a score strong,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
turned out to receive its occupants. All of them
bowed low, and all of them led the way up stairs.
Paul took a parlor and chamber for himself and lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where&#8217;s Joseph?&rdquo; asked Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s Joseph?&rdquo; inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the guide at this hotel, if he is still living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph was sent for, and soon made his appearance.
He was an elderly man, with gray hair and whiskers,
neatly dressed in black. His manners were very
agreeable, and he exhibited a lively zeal to serve the
tourists. Mr. Lowington had been courteously waited
upon by an officer of the government, who had
volunteered to have the various palaces, museums,
and other places of interest, opened during the afternoon
and the next day. Joseph had procured a two-horse
carriage, and the party at the hotel seated themselves
in it, with the guide on the box with the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the Slot,&rdquo; said Joseph, pointing across the
canal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Slot, or Palace of Christiansborg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slot! What a name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not any worse than the German word
<em>Schloss</em>,&rdquo; added Joseph, laughing. &ldquo;Do you speak
German, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guide uttered a few sentences in German, evidently
for the purpose of demonstrating that he spoke
the language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The palace is on an island called Slotsholm, and is
as big as it is ugly. Shall we go there now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we want a general view of the city first,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
replied Dr. Winstock. &ldquo;I think we had better
ascend to the top of the Round Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph gave the order, and the carriage proceeded to
the tower. The canal in front of the hotel was filled
with small craft, which had brought pottery and various
wares from other parts of Denmark, to sell. The
goods were arranged on the decks and on the shore
of the canal. Near were groups of women, who were
selling fish, vegetables, and other articles, around
whom was a crowd of purchasers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have heard of Andersen?&rdquo; said
Joseph to the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard of him! I have read all his books which
have been translated into English,&rdquo; replied Captain
Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has rooms in that building some of the time.
Do you see that sign&mdash;Melchoir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Melchoir is a very dear friend of Andersen,
who lives with him a portion of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible to see Hans Christian Andersen?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, madam. I will see about it to-day.
He is a very agreeable man, and willing to meet
all who wish to see him,&rdquo; answered Joseph. &ldquo;There&#8217;s
the Town Hall,&rdquo; he added, as the carriage passed a
large building, with an extensive colonnade in front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Med Lov skal man Land bygge</em>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lincoln,
reading an inscription on the front. &ldquo;Those are
my sentiments exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With law must the land be built&rsquo; is the English
of that,&rdquo; laughed Joseph. &ldquo;All the Jutland laws begin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with this phrase, which was spoken by Waldemar II.
We Danes believe in law, and everything that is
good. Copenhagen is a very fine city, and everything
is remarkably cheap here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call your city in your own lingo,
Joseph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kj&ouml;benhavn; pronounce it Ch&eacute;p-en-ahn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chepenahn,&rdquo; repeated Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak it a little quicker, and you will have it
right. It was first called simply the Haven; then in
Danish, when many merchants carried on business
here, <em>Kaupmannah&ouml;fn</em>, or merchants&#8217; haven, from
which it was shortened into <em>chepenahn</em>. Here is
the Round Tower,&rdquo; added Joseph, as the carriage
stopped.</p>

<p>The party alighted and entered the structure, which
was the tower of the Church of the Trinity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This used to be the watch tower, where men were
kept to give the alarm in case of fire; but the observatory
has been moved to the tower of St. Nicholas, and
now we have a telegraphic fire alarm. Won&#8217;t you
walk up to the top of this tower, where you can have
a fine view of the whole city? The ascent is very
easy,&rdquo; continued Joseph.</p>

<p>There were no stairs, but an inclined plane, gradual
in its rise, permitted the tourists to ascend to the summit
with very little labor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might have driven up in the carriage,&rdquo; said
Captain Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be no difficulty at all in doing so.
In fact, Peter the Great, when he was in Copenhagen,
in 1716, drove to the top with the Empress Catharine,
in a coach and four.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t remember so far back myself,&rdquo; chuckled
Joseph, &ldquo;for I&#8217;m not much over a hundred years old;
but everybody says it is true, and I see no reason to
doubt the story. Peter the Great liked to do strange
things, and you can see for yourself that a carriage
would run very well here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he went up with a coach and four, of course he
must have come down, unless the carriage and horses
are up there now. How did he turn his team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easier to ask some questions than to answer
them,&rdquo; replied Joseph. &ldquo;History does not say that he
drove down, only that he drove up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he backed down, which kings and emperors
are sometimes obliged to do, as well as common
people,&rdquo; suggested Paul Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely he did; I don&#8217;t see any other way for
the team to descend,&rdquo; added Joseph. &ldquo;This tower
was begun in 1639.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the top of the structure the travellers took a
general survey of the city, and then proceeded to
examine it in detail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the latitude of Copenhagen,
Captain Lincoln?&rdquo; asked Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About fifty-five and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same as the middle of Labrador. Quebec is
about forty-seven, and this is a long way farther north.
What is the population of this city, Joseph?&rdquo; asked
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundred and eighty-one thousand,&rdquo; replied
the guide, giving the census of 1870. &ldquo;Formerly the
city was a walled town, with ramparts and moats. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
was built partly on Seeland, and partly on the small
island of Amager. The channel between them is the
harbor. You can see where the old line of fortifications
was. The old town lies nearest to the sea, but
the city is now spreading rapidly out into the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that broad sheet of water, with two bridges
over it?&rdquo; asked Lincoln, pointing to the land side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the reservoir. Formerly the water in the
city was bad, but now it has an excellent system of
water-works. The water comes in from the country,
and is pumped up by steam before it is distributed.
Beyond that, for miles, the country is covered with
beautiful villas and country residences. You must ride
out there, for the environs of Copenhagen are as fine as
anything in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Joseph,&rdquo; added the doctor. &ldquo;Some
parts of the city are not unlike Holland, you see. The
Slotsholm canal gives that part of the town a decidedly
Dutch look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The part on Amager, called Christianshavn, is all
cut up by canals,&rdquo; added the guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, we will take a ride around the city,&rdquo; said
Paul Kendall.</p>

<p>The party descended, and having driven through
some of the principal streets, and obtained a very
good idea of the city, returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can dismiss the carriage, and we will
go to some of the museums and churches,&rdquo; suggested
Joseph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t care to walk far; we will retain the
carriage,&rdquo; replied Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be much cheaper to walk, as you have to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
pay four marks an hour for the carriage,&rdquo; pleaded the
economical guide. &ldquo;Thorwaldsen&#8217;s Museum and the
Northern Antiquities are only a few steps from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; we will walk, then, if you insist upon
it,&rdquo; laughed Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought these guides made you spend as much
money as possible,&rdquo; said Captain Lincoln to the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never found it so. I think they are a very useful
class of men. They charge here about two rigsdalers
a day, and I remember that Joseph would not let me
throw away a single mark. They know the prices for
carriages and everything else, and it is for their interest
not to let any one cheat their employers. Perhaps
it is not well to make purchases with them, for they
compel the merchant to pay them a commission,
which increases the price charged for the articles.
But I think, in many places, I have done better with
a <em>commissionnaire</em> than without one, in making purchases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph led the way across the bridge to Slotsholm,
which was nearly covered by the immense palace of
Christiansborg and its dependencies. The first building
was Thorwaldsen&#8217;s Museum, the outer walls of
which were covered with an Etruscan fresco of the
arrival and debarkation of the great sculptor and his
goods, mostly works of art. The figures are about
life size, and the situation in which the pictures are
placed is novel and quaint. The work was done by
inlaying cement of different colors in the wall. Joseph
described the various scenes. Thorwaldsen is still
held in the highest regard and veneration by all Denmark,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and especially by all Copenhagen; indeed, he
seems to be the great genius of the country. He was
born in 1770, near the city. His father was an Icelander,
and a carver in wood&mdash;a calling in which the
son assisted him when he was only a dozen years
old. At seventeen he received the prize of a silver
medal from the Academy of Arts, and at twenty-three
the grand prize, which carried with it a royal pension,
that enabled him to go abroad for the study of his art.
He went to Rome in 1796, where he had but little
success, and was reduced almost to despair, when his
model of Jason and the Golden Fleece attracted the
attention of an English gentleman, who commissioned
him to complete the work in marble. This event was
the dawn of success, and orders continued to pour in
upon him from the rich and the powerful, including
kings and emperors, until his fortune was made. His
works adorn many of the great cities of Europe, and
Canova was his only actual rival. His fame extended
to every nation, and a visit to his native land in 1819
was a triumphal progress through Italy and Germany.
In 1838 he returned to Copenhagen, to pass the remainder
of his days, in a frigate sent to Italy for his use by
the Danish government. On one side of his museum
are depicted his arrival in this ship, and his reception
by the citizens; and on the other side, the conveyance
of his works from the ship to their final destination.
Thorwaldsen went to Rome again on a visit for his
health, and died in Copenhagen in 1844. He was a
modest, generous, and amiable man. The museum
was erected by subscription, though the sculptor gave
a fourth part of the sum necessary for its erection, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
in his will bequeathed to it the works of art from his
cunning brain, of which its contents are almost entirely
composed. His biography has been written by
Hans Christian Andersen.</p>

<p>After examining the frescoes on the outer wall, the
party entered the building. It is an oblong structure,
with a court-yard in the middle. It is two stories in
height, with connected rooms extending entirely around
it. The works of art, and memorials of the sculptor,
are classified in these apartments, forty-two in number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the grave of Thorwaldsen,&rdquo; said Joseph,
leading the way into the court-yard. &ldquo;His body lies
there, surrounded by his works, as he requested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grave is an oblong enclosure of polished granite,
raised a few inches above the ground, and covered
over with ivy. At the foot of it is a black cross, with
the date of his death inscribed upon it.</p>

<p>The tourists walked through the various rooms, and
examined the works of the immortal genius, most of
which were in plaster, being the models of all his
great achievements set up in marble in various parts of
Europe. His pictures, his library, his collections of
coins, vases, and antiquities, are placed in the museum.
One room is fitted up with his furniture, precisely
as he used it, and various interesting mementos
of the man are to be seen there. Among the pictures
are some mere daubs, which are preserved only
because they belonged to Thorwaldsen; but they have
an interest as an illustration of the benevolent character
of the great sculptor, who ordered many of them
merely to save the artists from starvation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see Thorwaldsen?&rdquo; asked Lincoln,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
as Joseph conducted his charge from the
building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often,&rdquo; replied the guide. &ldquo;He was a venerable-looking
old man, with long, white hair. He made a
statue of himself, which is very like him. He died
suddenly in the theatre, and the king and royal family
followed his remains to the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Museum of Northern Antiquities was in the
old palace of a prince, on the other side of the canal.
On the front of the building were some quaint carvings,
which gave it a picturesque appearance. Joseph
seemed to be in his element at this museum. He
spoke glibly and learnedly of &ldquo;the stone age,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
bronze age,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the iron age,&rdquo; each designated by
the material of which the implements used for domestic
purposes, in war and agriculture, were composed.
Numberless utensils of all kinds are contained in the
cabinets, classified with rare skill, and arranged with
excellent taste. All these objects were found below
ground, in various parts of Scandinavia. In Denmark
the law requires that all antiquities of metal shall belong
to the government, which, however, pays the full
value of the articles to the finder. In 1847 a pair of
solid gold bracelets, very heavy, and elegantly wrought,
were dug up from the earth, and added to this collection.
There is a great variety of ornaments, in gold
and silver, consisting of necklaces, rings, bracelets,
and similar trinkets. One necklace contains three
pounds of pure gold.</p>

<p>There are plenty of knives, arrow-heads, hatchets,
hammers, chisels, and other implements, skilfully made
of stone. Runic writings, the most valuable in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
world, are collected here. Joseph said that certain
long pieces of wood, with signs carved upon them,
were Icelandic Calendars. The remains of a warrior,
who had fought and died in the ancient time, with the
iron mail of his day, were examined with interest, as
were also a number of altars, coffers containing relics,
and some gold crosses, one of which is said to contain
a splinter from the true cross, which were exhibited
as specimens of the Catholic form of worship in remote
times.</p>

<p>Recrossing the bridge over the canal, the party
entered the great, barn-like palace of Christiansborg.
It consists of several connected buildings, containing
a theatre, riding-school, stables, coach-houses, bake-house,
and the usual royal apartments. In 1168 a
castle was erected on this spot, as a protection against
pirates, which was repeatedly demolished, rebuilt,
altered, and enlarged, till it was levelled to the ground
in 1732, and a new palace erected, but was destroyed
by fire in 1784. It was rebuilt, in its present cumbrous
proportions, in 1828. The visitors entered
the large court-yard, passed through the picture gallery,
the &ldquo;Hall of the Knights,&rdquo; the throne-room,
looked into the riding-school,&mdash;which is a large, oblong
room, with an earth floor, where the royal family
may practise equestrianism,&mdash;the arsenal, the legislative
chambers, and other rooms, none of which were
very striking to those who had visited the palaces of
Paris, London, Berlin, and St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>In front of the palace is a beautiful green, beyond
which is the Exchange, or B&ouml;rsen, built by Christian
IV. It is the most picturesque edifice in the city,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
though the interior is entirely commonplace. It is
long and very narrow, and ornamented with a vast
number of figures cut in the stone, with elegantly-wrought
portals at the entrances. But the spire is the
most remarkable portion of the building, and consists
of four dragons, the heads at the apex looking towards
the four points of the compass.</p>

<p>From the Exchange the party walked to the Fruekirke,
or Church of our Lady, which is interesting
only on account of the works of Thorwaldsen which
it contains. Behind the altar is the majestic and
beautiful statue of Christ, which stretches out its
wounded hands, as if he were saying, &ldquo;Come unto
me, ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give
you rest.&rdquo; On each side of the church are the figures
of the twelve apostles, placed against the walls at
equal distances, so as to include the whole extent. In
the middle of the choir, in front of the altar, is the
figure of an angel, holding a baptismal font, in the
shape of a shell, which some call Thorwaldsen&#8217;s masterpiece.
In the sacristy of the church are several other
works of the great sculptor, who was first interred in
this place, before the museum was ready to receive
his remains.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendall declared she had seen enough for one
day, for sight-seeing is the hardest work one can do
when it is overdone. After supper, when the lady was
rested, she consented to visit Tivoli, where the students
were to spend the evening. This celebrated
resort of the Copenhageners is situated just outside of
the old walls of the city, near the arm of the sea which
divides Amager from Seeland. One of the two horse-railways,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
which the people in Europe generally persist
in calling &ldquo;tramways,&rdquo; extends through the city,
passing the gates of this garden. Several of the officers
and seamen of the ship came by the cars, which hardly
differ from those in use in the principal cities of the
United States; but all of them have accommodations
for passengers on the top.</p>

<p>Captain Lincoln&mdash;who had been on board of the
ship since he left the party with whom he had spent
the afternoon&mdash;and Norwood were passengers in a
car; but though they could not speak a word of Norsk,
they were not disturbed by the situation. Presently the
conductor presented himself, which caused a general
sounding of pockets among the occupants of the car.
He had a tin box, suspended by a strap, which passed
around his neck, to contain the money he received.
In his hand he held a compact little roll of yellow
paper, an inch and a half in width, across which was
printed a succession of little tickets, each with a number.
The fare was four skillings, or two and one
fourth cents, and, as each
person paid, the conductor
handed him one of these
papers, torn from the roll.
Captain Lincoln gave him
a piece of money, and held
up two fingers, pointing to
his companion at the same time, to indicate that he
paid for both. The man gave him his change, and
two of the yellow tickets.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img002.jpg" width="250" height="148" alt="Kjobenhavns Sporvei 4 Skilling 904" title="" />
</div>


<p>&ldquo;What are these for?&rdquo; asked Lincoln, glancing at
the little papers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
&ldquo;They are tickets, of course,&rdquo; replied Norwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think so,&rdquo; added the captain. &ldquo;All the
people seem to throw them away, and the floor of the
car is covered with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I know now what they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Norwood.
&ldquo;I have heard of such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know what &lsquo;knocking down&rsquo;
means&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&rdquo; laughed the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means stealing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so. It is said that conductors and omnibus
drivers at home &lsquo;knock down&rsquo; a good deal, which
is the technical name for taking a portion of the fares.
They use &lsquo;spotters&rsquo; in our country to keep the conductors
and drivers honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spotters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s the name of them. They are men and
women, whom the conductors cannot distinguish from
other passengers, employed by the railway companies
to ride in the cars, and report the number of passengers
on certain trips, so that the agents can tell whether
the fares are all paid over. These tickets are used for
the same purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see what good they do. They certainly
can&#8217;t keep the men honest, for almost everybody
throws away his ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are called control-marks,&rdquo; said a gentleman
next to the captain, who had been listening with interest
to the conversation, and who spoke good English.
&ldquo;The man has to tear one of them off every
time a passenger pays him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all numbered, I see; mine is nine hundred
and four,&rdquo; added Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
&ldquo;When the man gives up this roll at night, the
next number will show how many he has torn off.
If he began at No. 200 this morning, he has taken
seven hundred and four fares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he might neglect to tear off fifty or a hundred
in the course of a day,&rdquo; suggested Lincoln, &ldquo;and put
the money for them in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does so, everybody is watching him, and
anybody may report him to the agent. I am a share-owner
of the company, and for aught the conductor
knows, there may be one in every car. If the man
neglects his duty, my interest would prompt me to
look after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see; thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is Tivoli,&rdquo; added the gentleman. &ldquo;I suppose
you are going there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fine garden, and very cheap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young officers left the car, and bought tickets
at the gate, for which they paid one mark, or nine
cents, each. Near the entrance they found a man
selling programmes of the evening&#8217;s entertainment, at
two skillings each. Captain Lincoln bought one, for
he carefully preserved every handbill, ticket, or programme
for future reference. He could read a little
of it. The performances were varied, and covered the
time from six o&#8217;clock till midnight. But the young
officers preferred to take a general view of the premises.
It was an extensive garden, prettily and tastefully
laid out, with accommodations for concerts,
circus, and theatrical performances. In the centre
was a &ldquo;beer garden,&rdquo; with table and seats, for little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
parties, who drank their beer and chatted, while a
band played in a kiosk. Near it was a bazaar, where
all kinds of fancy articles were arranged for sale, with
the attendant raffles and lotteries. Farther removed
from the centre was a theatre, consisting, however, of
only the stage, the audience seating themselves in the
open air. The performance, from six to seven, as
the captain read in his programme, was</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>  <td align='center'><img src="images/r16.jpg" width="47" height="17" alt="R1. 6." title="" />  </td>
      <td class="tdp"></td>
      <td align='center'><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Entr&eacute;e gymnastique</strong></span></td>

      <td align='center'><img src="images/hermann.jpg" width="183" height="20" alt="Brodrene Hermann" title="" />  </td>  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Or, in plain English, a gymnastic exhibition by the
brothers Hermann.</p>

<p>In the circus there was a performance at half past
seven, such as one sees in the United States, and &ldquo;Hr.
Wallet&rdquo; was clown. At half past nine o&#8217;clock, another
exhibition was given in an enclosed building, to which
an extra admission fee was charged. At the theatre,
dancing by some &ldquo;celebrated sisters&rdquo; was in progress
at nine o&#8217;clock. A Russian mountain was in operation
during the whole evening. It was a railroad down
one inclined plane, and up another, and back over
the same track, a ride costing a few skillings. The
concert was continued at intervals during the entire
evening. The &ldquo;<em>caf&eacute; chantant</em>&rdquo; was in full blast after
nine o&#8217;clock, in two places, one of which was a small
hall, with a bar, and the other the interior of a Swiss
cottage, with a gallery surrounding it. In each of
these were tables, where the audience seated themselves,
and drank brandy, wine, beer, and milder
beverages. The singers, who are all females, stood
upon a stage, and were accompanied by a piano.
After one or two songs had been sung, one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
singers passed around among the audience with a
plate to receive their contributions, each person generally
giving a small copper coin. This order was
continually repeated, and the money thus received is
the only salary of the performers, whose singing is
villanously vile, and whose character is worse than
their singing. A canal, extending from the sea, comes
up to Tivoli, and passes around an island. Boats are
to let here; and, indeed, there is no end to the variety
of amusements, and &ldquo;all for nine cents,&rdquo; as Joseph
had said half a dozen times during the afternoon to
his party, and a dozen times more during the evening.
At half past ten the students returned to the squadron,
for by that time they had seen all they desired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>AN EXCURSION TO KLAMPENBORG AND ELSINORE.</strong></p>


<p>Peaks sat near the brig and read his book, which
he had procured from the librarian in anticipation
of a dull and heavy afternoon. Clyde sat in his
cage, watching the boatswain. The book was evidently
a very interesting one, for the reader hardly raised
his eyes from it for a full hour, and then only to bestow
a single glance upon the occupant of the ship&#8217;s
prison. The volume was Peter Simple, and the boatswain
relished the adventures of the hero. Once in a
while his stalwart frame was shaken by an earthquake
of laughter, for he had a certain sense of dignity which
did not permit him to laugh outright all alone by
himself, and so the shock was diffused through all his
members, and his body quaked like that of a man in
the incipient throes of a fever and ague fit. The magnanimous
conduct of O&#8217;Brien, who flogged Peter for
seasickness, simply because he loved him, proved to
be almost too much for the settled plan of the boatswain,
and it was with the utmost difficulty that he
restrained an outbreak of laughter.</p>

<p>For a full quarter of an hour Clyde convinced himself
that he was entirely satisfied with the situation.
The brig was not a bad place, or, at least, it would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
not be, if the boatswain would only leave the steerage
and allow the prisoner to be by himself. He wished
very much to try the carpenter&#8217;s saw upon the slats of
his prison. At the end of the second quarter of an hour,
the Briton was slightly nervous; the close of the third
found him rather impatient, and at the expiration of
an hour, he was decidedly provoked with Peaks for
staying where he was so long. When the stout sentinel
glanced at him, he flattered himself with a transitory
hope; but the boatswain only changed his position
slightly, and still appeared to be as deeply absorbed
as ever in the book.</p>

<p>Clyde was disgusted, and emphatically angry at the
end of another half hour. The brig was a vile place,
and putting a free-born Briton into such a den was
the greatest indignity which had yet been offered to
him. It was even worse than ordering him to be
silent, or to go forward. It was an insult which required
both redress and vengeance. He rose from his
seat, and walked to the door of his prison, but with
his gaze still fixed upon his jailer. He had come to
the conclusion that, if he moved, Peaks would, at least,
look at him; but that worthy did not raise his eyes
from his book. Clyde took hold of the barred door
and began to shake it, making considerable noise by
the act. Peaks took no notice whatever of him, and
it seemed just as though the boatswain intended to insult
him by thus disregarding him. He shook the
door again with more violence, but did not succeed
in attracting the attention of his custodian. Then he
began to kick the door. Making a run of the length
of the brig, he threw himself against it with all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
force he could, hoping to break it down; but he might
as well have butted against the side of the ship. It
yielded a little, and rattled a great deal; but it was too
strong to be knocked down in any such manner.</p>

<p>The prisoner was boiling over with wrath, as much
because Peaks did not notice him, as on account of the
indignity of his confinement. He kicked, wrenched,
and twisted at the door, till he had nearly exhausted
his own strength, apparently without affecting that of
the door. The boatswain still read, and still shook
with suppressed laughter at the funny blunders and
situations of Peter Simple. He had seen just such fellows
as Clyde in the brig; had seen them behave just
as the present prisoner did; and he had learned that
it was better to let them have their own way till they
were satisfied, for boys are always better satisfied when
they solve such problems for themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not going to stay in this place!&rdquo; howled Clyde,
when he had wasted all his powers upon the obstinate
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatswain happened to be at the end of a
chapter in his book, and he closed the volume, uttering
only the single negative participle, with the interrogative
inflection, as he glanced at his charge in the
brig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&#8217;m not!&rdquo; roared Clyde, rousing from his
seat, upon which he had dropped in sheer exhaustion,
and throwing himself desperately against the unyielding
door. &ldquo;I won&#8217;t stay in here any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I thought you would,&rdquo; added Peaks,
with the most provoking calmness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
&ldquo;I won&#8217;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it seems to me that you do stay there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll send for the British minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t stand it any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde dashed himself against the door again with
all the remaining force he had; but the boatswain,
apparently unmoved, opened his book again. It was
terribly lacerating to the feelings of the Briton to be so
coolly disregarded and ignored. Clyde had the saw,
but he had sense enough left to know that any attempt
to use it would attract the attention of his jailer, and
end in the loss of the implement, with which he could
remove a couple of the slats when left alone, or when
all hands were asleep at night. Finding that violence
accomplished nothing, he seated himself on his stool,&mdash;which,
however, was far from being the stool of repentance,&mdash;and
considered the situation more calmly.
He was in a profuse perspiration from the energy of
his useless exertions. Perhaps he was conscious that
he had made a fool of himself, and that his violence
was as impolitic as it was useless. In a few moments
he was as quiet as a lamb, and remained so for half
an hour, though his bondage was no less galling than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Peaks,&rdquo; said he, in the gentlest of tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my lad, what shall I do for you?&rdquo; replied
the boatswain, closing his book, and going to the door
of the brig.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&#8217;m very thirsty, and want a glass of water. Will
you give me one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatswain passed a mug of water through the
bars, and Clyde drank as though he was really thirsty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have worked hard, and it makes you dry,&rdquo;
said Peaks. &ldquo;You can keep a mug of water in the
brig if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Clyde, as he placed the mug on
the deck, after the boatswain had filled it. &ldquo;Can&#8217;t
you let me out, Mr. Peaks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will&mdash;won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On certain conditions, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What conditions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you won&#8217;t attempt to run away. But, my
lad, it is only a few hours since you said the brig was
a very nice place, and you would grow gray in it before
you would promise not to leave when you got a
good chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&#8217;t tried it, then. But I think it is an insult
to a fellow to put him in here. I would rather be
flogged outright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t flog the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather take a flogging, and have it done
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we don&#8217;t do it. We
don&#8217;t want to have it done with till the boy means to
do about right. You are a smart boy, my lad; but
you have got a heap of bad blood in your veins, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
ought to be worked off. If you would only do your duty
like a man, you would be comfortable and happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never can stay in this ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand the duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon learn all the ropes in the ship, and
they will all come as handy to you as the key of your
own watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde pulled out his watch, and glanced at the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a nice time-keeper you have, my lad; gold,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it cost thirty pounds. Wouldn&#8217;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a pretty good silver one, which
answers my purpose very well,&rdquo; replied Peaks, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll give it to you, if you will let me out, and permit
me to go on shore,&rdquo; added Clyde, in an insinuating
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lad, I don&#8217;t want it bad enough to
do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can sell it, you know. Or I will give you
thirty pounds in cash, if you prefer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t afford to do it for that,&rdquo; laughed the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll give you fifty pounds then,&rdquo; persisted Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t afford to do it for that, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say sixty, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say a hundred, if you like, my lad; and then say
a thousand. I can&#8217;t afford to do it for all the money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
your mother is worth. You are on the wrong tack,
my lad. I can&#8217;t be bought at any price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t ask you to let me out. If you will only
go on deck, and keep out of the way, I will manage
it all myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; sheer off, my hearty. When I have a
duty to do, I always mean to do it; and if it isn&#8217;t
done, it isn&#8217;t my fault. You can&#8217;t leave the ship with
my consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t stay here, I say. I should die in a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, die like a man, then,&rdquo; said Peaks,
good-naturedly; for, though he could not be bought at
any price, he did not indulge in any righteous indignation
against his victim. &ldquo;Learn your duty, and
then do it. There is plenty of fun going on in the
ship, and you will enjoy yourself as soon as you get
on the right tack. That&#8217;s the up and down of the
whole matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t take off my cap to these young squirts of
officers, and be ordered around by them. It isn&#8217;t in
an Englishman to do anything of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I think it is in them. They make
first-rate sailors, and always obey their officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Common sailors do; but I&#8217;m a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I; but I always obey orders,&rdquo; replied the
democratic Peaks, warmly. &ldquo;The officers of this ship
are required to behave like gentlemen, and give their
orders in a gentlemanly manner. If they don&#8217;t do it,
they are liable to be reduced. Do your duty, and you
may be an officer yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peaks continued for some time to give the prisoner
good advice, assuring him that he was no better than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the rest of the crew, and that it would not hurt him
any more than others to obey the orders of the officers.
But it was sowing seed in stony ground, and Clyde,
finding he could make nothing out of the honest boatswain,
decided to await his time with what patience
he could command, which, however, was not much.
Peaks was permitted to follow Peter Simple in his
stirring career during the rest of the afternoon. The
crew returned from Tivoli at eleven in the evening,
and soon the ship was quiet, with only an anchor
watch, consisting of an officer on the quarter-deck, and
two seamen on the forecastle.</p>

<p>Clyde&#8217;s supper was given to him in his prison, and
a bed made up for his use. He kept awake till all the
students came on board, and while he was waiting for
the crew to slumber, he dropped asleep himself, and
did not wake till all hands were called in the morning.
He was vexed with himself for his neglect, and afraid
that the carpenter would miss the saw, and remember
where he had left it. He was determined to keep
awake the next night, and make his escape, even if he
was obliged to swim to the land.</p>

<p>After breakfast, all the students went on shore for
an excursion to Klampenborg and Elsinore. In the
custom-house enclosure, a procession of four in a rank
was formed, to march to the railroad station, which
was near the Tivoli Garden. The students were generally
rather fond of processions, not at home, but in
the streets of foreign cities. The parade was quite
imposing, when every officer and seaman wore his
best uniform. They had been carefully taught to
march, and Professor Badois had organized a band of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
eight pieces, which performed a few tunes very well.
Unfortunately, on the present occasion, the band was
not available, for Stockwell, the cornet player, and
Boyden, the bass drummer, belonged to the absent crew
of the second cutter, and the procession moved to the
sterling notes of the drum and fife.</p>

<p>On parades of this kind, the first and second pursers
acted as the fleet staff of the commodore, who
would otherwise have been &ldquo;alone in his glory,&rdquo; and
these two useful officers seemed like &ldquo;odds and ends&rdquo;
in any other position. As this procession was frequently
formed, and marched through the streets of
various cities, the order is given to satisfy the reasonable
curiosity of the reader.</p>

<p class="center">
                    Music.<br />
               The Commodore,<br />
           And Staff of the Fleet.<br />
      The Captain of the Young America.<br />
              The Four Masters.<br />
            The Four Midshipmen.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>

     The Second Part of the Port Watch.<br />
        The Captain of the Tritonia.<br />

     The First Part of the Port Watch.<br />
          The Fourth Lieutenant.<br />
     The Second Part of the Port Watch.</p>

<p>Sometimes the order was varied by placing all the
officers at the head of the procession, except the lieutenants
in command of sections, as,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
         The Commodore and Staff.<br />
           The three Captains.<br />
         Three ranks of Masters.<br />
         One rank of Midshipmen.</p>

<p>But keeping all the officers and seamen of each vessel
together, as in the first order, was generally preferred.
Of course the ranks were not always full, as on the
present occasion; but even when the full band was at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the head of the column, there were enough for four
full ranks in each half-watch of the ship, and two
ranks in those of the other vessels. The students had
practised so much that they marched exceedingly well,
and being aligned according to their height, the effect
was very fine. The Copenhageners left their occupations,
and hastened to the doors and windows of their
houses and shops to see the procession; and even the
king and royal family were spectators at the palace
windows, as the column moved through Frederiksplads.
As it passed the Royal Hotel, Mr. and Mrs.
Kendall, with Dr. Winstock and Joseph, were entering
a carriage, in which they intended to ride to Klampenborg,
in order to see more of the country. At the
railroad station, the officers and seamen took seats in
the third-class carriages, which were two stories high,
the upper as well as the lower one having a roof. The
distance to Klampenborg is eight and a half English
miles, and the fare is sixteen skillings, or nine cents,
third class; twenty-four skillings, or thirteen and a
half cents, second class; and thirty-two skillings, or
eighteen cents, first class. The third-class compartments
are clean and neat, but there are no cushions
on the seats. An aisle extends through the middle
of them, but the seats are placed in pairs, on each
side, so that half the passengers are compelled to ride
backwards. In about half an hour the train arrived
at Klampenborg.</p>

<p>Paul Kendall&#8217;s party drove first to the summer residence
of Mr. Melchoir, which was in the suburbs of
the city, near the sea-shore. The house was a very
pretty one, with a neat garden, not unlike the little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
country places one sees in the vicinity of the large
cities of the United States. Joseph rang the bell, and
stated the errand of the party to the servant. They
were shown up one flight of stairs, where the girl
knocked at the door, which was immediately opened
by Hans Christian Andersen, and the tourists were
ushered into a plainly-furnished room, with a few engravings
on the walls. On a table were the writing-materials
of the great author, and Paul looked with
interest at the little pile of letter sheets, closely written
over, and the unfinished one, on which the ink was not
yet dry.</p>

<p>Mr. Andersen&#8217;s face was covered with a smile as
he greeted the party. Dr. Winstock had met him
before, and stated the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I&#8217;m very glad to see you again,&rdquo; said the author,
grasping the doctor&#8217;s hand with both of his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My young friend here, and his lady, have both
read all your books, and desired to see you even more
than to look upon the beautiful works of your great
sculptor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are very kind,&rdquo; added Mr. Andersen,
again grasping the doctor&#8217;s hand with both of his
own.</p>

<p>Then, darting nervously to Paul, he seized his hand
in the same manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Captain Paul Kendall, commander of the
yacht Grace,&rdquo; added Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so pleased to see you!&rdquo; said Mr. Andersen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read all your books with the most intense
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you are too kind, Captain Kendall,&rdquo; replied the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
genial author, smiling all over his face, and once more
grasping his hand as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kendall,&rdquo; added Paul, presenting Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so pleased to see you! You are very kind to
take so much trouble to visit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, you are very kind to permit us to
trouble you, when you are so busy,&rdquo; continued Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I have plenty of time to see my good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In America we love your books, and they are in
all our libraries and most of our houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so kind to speak so pleasantly of my
works!&rdquo; replied Mr. Andersen, grasping Paul&#8217;s hand
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We value them very highly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation continued for a few moments, in
which Paul and the doctor expressed the high appreciation
of the reading public of the great writer&#8217;s
works. At least a dozen times more he grasped the
hand of the speaker with both his. Mr. Andersen is a
tall gentleman, with a thin face,&mdash;the features of which
are far from handsome,&mdash;and iron-gray hair. His
countenance is always covered with smiles when he
speaks, and his whole manner is child-like and simple.
He is full of the love of God and of man, which seems
to shine out in his face, and to be the interpretation of
his ever-present smile. His dress was scrupulously
neat and nice in every detail.</p>

<p>The doctor told him about the Academy squadron,
of which he had read a brief notice in the newspapers,
and invited him to visit the ship, which he promised
to do, on the following day. The party took their
leave of him, and continued on the way to Klampenborg.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
The road was on the margin of the sea, and
was lined with small country houses, with pleasant
gardens. It was a lovely region, with an occasional
large villa, and even a summer palace or two. All
along this road, called the Strandway, are small and
large houses of entertainment, on the sea-side, each
one of which has a bathing establishment on a very
small and simple scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is Charlottelund Castle, in this park,&rdquo; said
Joseph, as they passed what seemed to be merely a
grove, with a rather dilapidated fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was formerly the country-seat of the Landgrave
of Hesse, I believe,&rdquo; added Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but it is now the summer residence of
the crown prince. He comes out here in June.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These carriages are called &lsquo;privateers,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued
the guide, pointing to several vehicles like a small
omnibus with no top. &ldquo;They formerly went by the
name of &lsquo;coffee-mills,&rsquo; because they made a noise like
those machines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Constantia Tea-Garden, where the Copenhageners
go to spend the evening in hot weather, and several
fishing villages, were passed, and then the carriage
reached the Deer Park, where the students had already
arrived, which is a very extensive enclosure, with
a few roads extending through it. A portion of it is
covered with groves, and it contains about a thousand
deer, which are quite tame, and may be seen grazing
in herds on the gentle slopes. There is nothing very
attractive in the park, though it is much frequented by
the people from the city. Neither the roads nor the
grounds are well kept, and the government &ldquo;turns an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
honest penny&rdquo; by the letting of it out for the pasturage
of horses. On some rising ground, which Denmarkers
call a hill, is a large, square, barn-like building,
known as the &ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; which was built by
Christian VI. for a hunting lodge. This park and
that at Charlottelund contain thousands of acres of
excellent land, which is almost useless, and which the
government cannot afford to keep in condition as
pleasure-grounds. They would make thousands of
farms, and thus increase the productive industry and
the revenues of the nation, if they could be cut up and
sold. Royalty is an expensive luxury, which a small
kingdom like Denmark cannot afford to support.</p>

<p>Near the entrance to the park is the garden proper
of Klampenborg, where music is provided on summer
evenings, and refreshments sold. What is called a
Norwegian house is erected in the middle of the
grounds, which contains a bar and private rooms, and
is surrounded by tables and chairs, where the pleasure-seekers
may sit and enjoy their beer and the music.
A small fee for admission is paid at the gate, where
the ticket-seller is kept honest by the aid of the &ldquo;control-mark.&rdquo;
Near this garden is a hotel built for a
water-cure establishment, though it is now mainly
used as a summer boarding-house. Close by it is a
village of small cottages, devoted to the same use,
with concert-rooms and bathing-houses in abundance.
This place is a favorite resort of the Copenhageners in
summer,&mdash;in fact, their Newport or Long Branch.
For a couple of hours the students wandered through
the park and gardens. The railroad station is very
near the entrance, where, indeed, the whole beauty of
the place is concentrated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
The railway to Klampenborg is a branch of the one
which extends from Copenhagen to Elsinore, and in
another hour the entire party were transported to the
latter place. This town has nine or ten thousand inhabitants,
and is located on a basin of the Sound,
nearly land-locked by natural and artificial dikes.
The Danish name of the place is Helsing&ouml;r, and is
the scene of Shakespeare&#8217;s tragedy of Hamlet. The
excursionists visited the cathedral, which is the principal
object of interest in Elsinore, and contains several
very old tombs. Near the town, and on the
shore of the Sound, is the Castle of Kronberg, erected
in 1580. It is a large, oblong, Gothic structure, built
of a whitish stone. It contains a chapel and other
apartments. Those occupied by the commandant
were the prison of Caroline Matilda, who was confined
here for a high crime, of which she is now universally
believed to be innocent.</p>

<p>Under the castle are casemates for a thousand men,
one of which is said to be the abode of <em>Holger
Danske</em>, who was the Cid Campeador of Denmark,
and the hero of a thousand legends. When the state
is in peril, he is supposed to march at the head of the
armies, but never shows himself at any other time.
A farmer, says the story, happened into his gloomy
retreat by accident, and found him seated at a stone
table, to which his long white beard had grown. The
mystic hero demanded the hand of his visitor, who
was afraid to trust flesh and blood in the grasp of one
so mighty, and offered the iron bar used to fasten the
door. Holger Danske seized it, and squeezed it so
hard that he left the print of his fingers on the iron.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ha, I see there are still <em>men</em> in Denmark!&rdquo; said
he, with a grim smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Near the castle are a couple of natural ponds, small
and round, which are called &ldquo;Holger Danske&#8217;s Spectacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where Hamlet lived, I suppose,&rdquo; said Captain
Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where Shakespeare says he lived,&rdquo; replied Dr.
Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was told his grave was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Hamlet divided himself up, and occupied
a dozen graves, for I think you may find a dozen of
them here,&rdquo; laughed the doctor. &ldquo;A resident of this
vicinity had what was called the grave of Hamlet in
his grounds, which proved to be a nuisance to him,
on account of the great number of visitors who came
to see it. In order to relieve himself of this injury to
his garden, he got up another &lsquo;grave of Hamlet,&rsquo; in
another place, which he proved to be the authentic
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too bad to trifle with history in that manner,&rdquo;
protested the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no history about it, Lincoln. His residence
in this part of Denmark is all a fiction. Shakespeare
makes terrible blunders in his allusions to this
place; for there is no &lsquo;eastern hill,&rsquo; no &lsquo;dreadful
summit of the cliff,&rsquo; or anything of the sort. Hamlet
lived in Jutland, not in Seeland, about four centuries
before Christ, and was the son of a pirate chief,
instead of a king, who, with his brother, was governor
of the province. He married the daughter of the
king, who was Hamlet&#8217;s mother. The chief was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
murdered by his brother, who married the widow,
and was then the sole governor. Hamlet, in order to
avenge his father&#8217;s death, feigned madness; but his
uncle, suspecting the trick, sent him to England, with
a message carved in wood, requesting the king to
destroy him. During the voyage, he obtained the
wooden letter, and altered it so as to make it ask for
the killing of the two men, creatures of his uncle, who
had charge of him, which was done on their arrival.
According to the style of romances, he married the
king&#8217;s daughter, and afterwards returned to Jutland,
where, still pretending insanity, he contrived to surprise
and slay his uncle. He succeeded his victim as
governor, and married a second time, to a queen of
Scotland, and was finally killed in battle. The main
features of the tragedy correspond with the incidents
of the story, but the locality is not correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party walked to Marienlyst, a pleasant watering-place,
which contains a small royal chateau. The
view from this place, as from the tower of Kronberg,
is very beautiful. At four o&#8217;clock the party took the
steamer, and arrived at Copenhagen before dark.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TO STOCKHOLM BY G&Ouml;TA CANAL.</strong></p>


<p>The Wadstena, in which the absentees had taken
passage at Gottenburg, was a small steamer,
but very well fitted up for one of her size. Forward
was the saloon, in which meals were taken, and saloon
passengers slept. Aft was the cabin, on each side of
which were state-rooms, called &ldquo;h&uuml;tte.&rdquo; They were
not made with regular berths, but had a sofa on each
side of the door, on which the beds were made up at
night, with a wash-stand between them. Between
this cabin and the forward saloon the main deck was
raised about three feet, so as to cover the engine and
boilers. On each side of this higher deck were more
&ldquo;h&uuml;tte,&rdquo; which were the best rooms on board. The
hurricane-deck, over the after cabin, was the favorite
resort of the passengers.</p>

<p>It was two o&#8217;clock in the morning, and the independent
excursionists were tired and sleepy. They
had taken first-class tickets, and two of them had been
assigned to each &ldquo;h&uuml;tte.&rdquo; As soon as they went on
board, therefore, they retired, and most of them slept,
in spite of the fleas and other vermin that revelled
in their banquet of blood. None but very tired boys
could have slumbered under such unfavorable circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and it is a great pity that a steamer otherwise
so neat and comfortable should be given up to the
dominion of these sleep-destroying insects.</p>

<p>At seven the party turned out, anxious to see the
scenery on the banks of the canal. The steamer was
still in the river, a stream not more than a hundred
and fifty feet wide, with occasional rapids, which are
passed by canals, with locks in them. The scenery
was pleasant, with rocky hills on each side. Schooners
and other craft were continually met, loaded with lumber
and other articles from the lakes. The scene was
novel and interesting, and though the boys gaped
fearfully, they enjoyed the view.</p>

<p>Presently one of the women, who do all the work
of stewards and waiters, appeared with coffee on
deck, passing the cups to the passengers first, and
then filling them. The coffee was delicious, served
with the whitest of sugar and the richest of cream,
with some little biscuits. It waked the boys up, and
seemed to make new beings of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;s this, Sanford?&rdquo; said Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First rate! That&#8217;s the best coffee I ever drank in
my life,&rdquo; replied the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a free blow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. How is it, Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you pay at the end of the trip for all you
have had,&rdquo; replied the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who keeps the account?&rdquo; asked Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; laughed Ole. &ldquo;On the boats from
Christiania every passenger tells what he has had,
and pays for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they think everybody is honest?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
&ldquo;Certainly; everybody is honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; added Sanford, shaking his head.
&ldquo;Of course you don&#8217;t pretend to be honest, Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t take a sovereign from me, and another
from Burchmore&mdash;did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take what you give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be honest, but I don&#8217;t see it in that light,
Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now, Sanford,&rdquo; interposed Burchmore.
&ldquo;He sold out the last time for the public
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to find the ship in Stockholm when
we get there?&rdquo; asked Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied Sanford. &ldquo;We shall not
get there till Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then our cruise is almost ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. I have been trying hard to join the
ship ever since we left her at Christiansand,&rdquo; continued
the coxswain, solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the left,&rdquo; chuckled Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honor bright! I don&#8217;t believe in running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I; but Laybold and I have put our foot into
it. I suppose we shall have to spend a week in the
brig, and make love to Peaks while the rest of the fellows
are seeing Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find some way to get out of the scrape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. We have lost Copenhagen and
Denmark already, and I suppose we shall not see
much of Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will help you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think you can do it,&rdquo; added Scott, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
had evidently come to the conclusion that running
away &ldquo;did not pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steamer stopped, and the captain informed
the party that passengers usually walked three miles
around the series of locks, by which they were enabled
to see the Falls of Trollh&auml;tten. The carrying
of the canal around these falls was the most difficult
problem in engineering in the construction of the
work. It is cut through the solid rock, and contains
sixteen locks. The passage of the steamer occupies
an hour and a half, which affords ample time for the
voyagers to see the falls. The party immediately
landed, and were promptly beset by a dozen ragged
boys, who desired to act as guides, where no such
persons are needed. Not one of them spoke a word
of English; but they led the way to the path, each one
selecting his own victims, and trusting to the magnanimity
of the passengers for their pay. A walk,
covered with saw-dust, has been made by some public-spirited
persons, and the excursion is a very pleasant
one.</p>

<p>The entire fall of the river is one hundred and
twelve feet; but it is made in four principal cataracts,
and three smaller ones. The scenery in the vicinity
is rather picturesque, and at one point the path goes
through a grove, on the banks of a rivulet, where the
water dashes over large cobble-stones, with an occasional
pretty cascade. The walk leads to various
eligible spots for examining the falls and the rapids.
On the way, the tourist passes <em>Kungsgrottan</em>, or
King&#8217;s Grotto. It is a hole in the solid rock, in the
shape of half a globe, on the sides of which are inscribed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the names of the various sovereigns of Sweden,
and other distinguished persons who have visited the
spot. Near the village of Trollh&auml;tten, which contains
several founderies and saw-mills, the finest part of the
falls is seen by crossing an iron foot-bridge, at the
gate of which stands a woman, who collects a toll of
fifty &ouml;re for the passage to the little island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think much of these falls,&rdquo; said Scott, as
he returned from the island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they are rather fine,&rdquo; replied Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could cut up the rapids of Niagara into about
two hundred just such falls, to say nothing of the big
cataract itself,&rdquo; added Scott. &ldquo;It is pleasant, this
walk along the river, but you can&#8217;t call the Falls of
Trollh&auml;tten a big thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they don&#8217;t compare with Niagara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party walked through the yards of the manufactories,
and came to a small hotel on the bank of
the canal. The place looked very much like many
American villages. The canal steamer did not appear
for half an hour, and some of the boys strolled about
the place. The regiment of ragged boys who had
followed the tourists, or led the way, pointing out the
various falls and other points of interest in an unknown
tongue, begged lustily for the payment for their services.
One of them, who had taken Scott and Laybold
under his protection, was particularly urgent in his
demands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a red, my hearty,&rdquo; replied Scott. &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t
engage you, and I shall not pay you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy still held out his hand, and said something
which no one of the party could understand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; replied Scott. &ldquo;You told me the
names of all the places, but I did not understand a
word you said. I say, my lad, when did you escape
from the rag-bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy uttered a few words in Swedish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stick to it, my hearty; but I don&#8217;t believe a word
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he say, Scott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says the moon is made of green cheese.
Didn&#8217;t you, my lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy nodded, and spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a hard case, Young Sweden; but I can&#8217;t do
anything for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s a hard case, Scott?&rdquo; asked Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he says he has six fathers and five mothers,
and he has to support them all by guiding tourists
round the falls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid they don&#8217;t have roast beef for dinner
every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s the steamer,&rdquo; added Laybold.</p>

<p>The boy became more importunate as the time
came to go on board, but Scott was obstinate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, out of my way, my lad. Give my regards
to your six fathers and five mothers, and I&#8217;ll remember
you in my will; but I won&#8217;t give you a solitary
red now, because I don&#8217;t like the principle of the
thing. I didn&#8217;t employ you, and I didn&#8217;t want you.
I told you so, and shook my head at you, and told
you to get behind me, Satan, and all that sort of thing;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and now I&#8217;m not going to pay you for making a
nuisance of yourself. On the naked question of
charity, I could do something for you, on account
of your numerous fathers and mothers. As it is,
good by, Sweden;&rdquo; and Scott went on board of the
steamer.</p>

<p>The boat started again, and soon the bell rang for
breakfast. The boys hastened to the forward saloon,
where they found two tables spread. At a sideboard
was the Swedish lunch, or snack, of herring, sliced
salmon, various little fishes, sausage, and similar delicacies,
with the universal decanter of &ldquo;finkel,&rdquo; flanked
with a circle of wine glasses. The tourists partook
of the eatables, but most of them were wise enough to
avoid the drinkable. The Swedish bread, which is a
great brown cracker, about seven inches in diameter,
was considered very palatable. Ordinary white bread
is served on steamers and at hotels, and also a dark-colored
bread, which looks like rye, and is generally
too sour for the taste of a foreigner. The breakfast at
the tables consisted of fried veal, and fish, with vegetables,
and all the elements of the snack. When the
boys had finished, one of the women handed Scott a
long narrow blank book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, marm; I am much obliged to you,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Will you have the kindness to inform me
what this is for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman laughed, and answered him in her native
tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; added Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants me to write a love letter in this book
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to her; but as she is rather ancient, I shall decline in
your favor, Sanford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t do it, old fellow! Face the music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for Joseph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say, Ole?&rdquo; inquired Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said you were to keep your account in that
book,&rdquo; replied the interpreter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we to keep our own reckoning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; every one puts down in this book what he
has had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means you, Burchmore. You are the cashier
for the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many fellows had coffee this morning?&rdquo;
asked the cashier, as he took the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burchmore made the entries for the coffee and the
breakfasts of the whole party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&#8217;s one way to do the thing,&rdquo; said Scott.
&ldquo;Every man his own book-keeper. I&#8217;ll bet everybody
doesn&#8217;t charge what he has had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole was requested to ask the woman about the matter.
She said the Swedes were honest, but the waiters
were required to see that everybody paid for what
he had had before leaving the steamer. The having of
this book is certainly a better plan than that of the
Norwegian steamers, by which the passenger, if he
means to be honest, is compelled to recollect all he
has had in a passage of thirty hours.</p>

<p>The Wadstena continued on her course through a
rather flat country, just coming into the greenness and
beauty of the spring time, till she came to Wenersberg,
a town of five thousand inhabitants, which is largely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
engaged in the lumber and iron trade. The boat
stopped there a short time, and the party had an opportunity
to examine the lake craft at the wharves;
but, after seeing them, it was difficult to believe they
were not in some New England coast town. The
steamers, however, were very different, all of them
being very short, to enable them to pass through the
locks in the canal, and most of them having the hurricane
deck forward and aft, to afford sufficient space
for the cabins. All of them were propellers.</p>

<p>The Wadstena started again, the bridges opening to
permit her passage. The great Wenern Lake lay before
them, which is the third in size in Europe, Onega
and Ladoga alone exceeding it in extent. It is about
a hundred miles long by fifty in breadth, very irregular
in shape, and portions of it are densely crowded
with islands. Its greatest depth is three hundred and
sixty feet near the Island of Lur&ouml;, but a considerable
part of it is very shallow, and difficult of navigation.
It is one hundred and forty-five feet above the level of
the Baltic. Thirty rivers flow into it, and sometimes
cause it to rise ten feet above its ordinary level. But
the G&ouml;ta River is its only outlet, and is always supplied
with an abundant volume of water. The wind
was fresh when the Wadstena steamed out upon the
broad expanse, and the lake had a decidedly stormy
aspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be seasick?&rdquo; asked the captain, as the
little steamer began to bob up and down with a very
uncomfortable jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seasick!&rdquo; laughed Scott. &ldquo;We are all sailors,
sir, and we don&#8217;t intend to cave in on a fresh-water
pond.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
&ldquo;But the lake is very rough to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your little tub can stand it, captain, we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad, for some people are very sick on
this part of the passage. It is sometimes very bad,
the worst we have in the whole trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long are we on the lake?&rdquo; asked Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About seven hours; but not all of it is so bad as
this. We go among the islands by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubtless the Wenern Lake fully maintained its
reputation on the present occasion, though none of the
young salts were sick. The boat stood to the northward,
and the short steamer and the short chop sea
would have made the passage very trying to landsmen.
Nothing but the distant shores were to be seen, and
the monotony of the passage was the only disagreeable
circumstance to our tourists. For the want of
something better to do, they went below, and, lying
down on the sofas in their state-rooms, went to sleep
without much difficulty, for the red-backs and fleas
kept shady in the daytime. The boys were accustomed
to being &ldquo;rocked in the cradle of the deep;&rdquo;
but at the expiration of three hours, the heavy motion
ceased, and the change waked them. Going on the
hurricane deck again, they found the steamer was
among the islands, which were generally low, rocky,
and covered with firs and pines. A crooked channel
was carefully buoyed off, and the boat was threading
its tortuous way with no little difficulty.</p>

<p>Presently the Wadstena made a landing at a rude
pier on an island where only a rough shanty was in
sight. Several row-boats at the wharf indicated that
passengers came to this station from other islands.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Again the steamer went out upon the open lake, and
soon after entered another group of islands, among which
she made a landing at a small town. Passing over
another open space, the entrance to the canal was discovered,
marked by two low light-houses, in the form
of the frustum of a pyramid. As the Wadstena entered
a lock, the captain told the party they might
take a walk if they pleased, as there were several locks
to pass in the next three miles. This was a grateful
relief to the voyagers, and they gladly availed themselves
of the opportunity. The country was a dead
level, with an occasional small farm-house, and with
many groves and forests. But the walk was interesting,
and the boys would gladly have continued it
longer; but at the last lock of the series, the gate-man
told them, through Ole, that they must wait here in
order to go on board, for the steamer could not make
a landing again for several miles. The party remained
on the hurricane deck till the cold and the darkness
drove them below. Turning in at an early hour, they
slept as well as the vermin would allow, until six
o&#8217;clock the next morning, when the steamer was
approaching the Wettern Lake, the second in size in
Sweden. The boat was on a broad arm of the lake,
called the Viken, for the canal is built only across
the narrowest section of country, between two natural
bodies of water.</p>

<p>The Wettern Lake is ninety miles long and fifteen
miles wide, surrounded by hills, from which sudden
gusts of wind come, producing violent squalls on the
water. This lake is noted for big trout. After crossing
the Wettern, the steamer approached Wadstena,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
which contains an ancient church and convent, and a
castle built by Gustavus Vasa, and often occupied by
his family. Ten miles farther brought the steamer to
Motala, which contains several iron founderies and
manufactories. Many iron steamers and steam engines
are built at this place. The scenery on this
portion of the canal is very beautiful, though not
grand. Going through another portion of the artificial
canal, the boat enters the Roxen Lake, perhaps the
most beautiful in Sweden, and makes a landing at
Link&ouml;ping. There are half a dozen towns with this
termination in the country, as Norrk&ouml;ping, S&ouml;derk&ouml;ping,
J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping, the last two syllables being pronounced
like <em>chepping</em>; as, Lin-chep-ping.</p>

<p>Leaving the Roxen Lake, the steamer passes through
more canals into an arm of the Baltic, and then into
the sea itself, voyaging among a thousand small
islands, stopping at S&ouml;derk&ouml;ping and Nyk&ouml;ping, important
commercial and manufacturing towns. Night
came, and our tourists did not stay up to see the lights
on the way. The steamer leaves the Baltic, and passing
another piece of canal, enters the waters of the M&auml;ler
Lake, seventy-five miles long, and containing fourteen
hundred islands. The boys were up in season to
see the beauties of this lake. Many of the islands rise
to a considerable height above the water, and are so
thick that one hardly believes he is sailing on a large
lake. For quiet beauty and &ldquo;eternal stillness,&rdquo; the
M&auml;ler can hardly be surpassed. In the middle of the
forenoon, the spires of Stockholm were to be seen, and
the tourists were all attention. From the lake the
city presents a fine appearance. Indeed, Stockholm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
seen from either of its water approaches, is hardly
excelled in beauty by any city in Europe.</p>

<p>The Wadstena made her landing at the Island of
Riddarholm. As the party were not burdened with
any baggage, they decided to walk to the hotel. Ole
inquired the way to the Hotel Rydberg, where they
had agreed to go; and crossing a bridge to the largest
of the three islands of the city, called Stadeholm, they
arrived at the palace, beyond which is the quay. Between
this island and the main land, on which the
greater portion of the town is built, is the passage from
the Baltic to the M&auml;ler Lake, and in the middle of it
is the Island of Helgeandsholm, or Holy Ghost&#8217;s Island,
with two bridges connecting it with either side. On
it are the king&#8217;s stables, and a semicircular garden,
improved as a <em>caf&eacute;</em>, with a handsome face wall on the
water side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&#8217;t bad,&rdquo; said Scott, as the party paused to
look down into the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Sanford. &ldquo;I suppose they
have music here in the evening, and it would be a
capital place to loaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See the steamers!&rdquo; exclaimed Laybold, as a
couple of the miniature craft, which abound in the
waters of Stockholm, whisked up to the quay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow could put half a dozen of them into his
trousers pocket,&rdquo; laughed Scott. &ldquo;We must go on a
cruise in some of them, as soon as we get settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where&#8217;s the hotel?&rdquo; asked Sanford.</p>

<p>It was in plain sight from the bridge, which they
crossed to the Square of Gustavus Adolphus, on which
the hotel faced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
&ldquo;Good morning, young gentlemen. I am happy to
see you,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaine, the head steward of the
ship, who was the first person to greet them as they
entered the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Blaine!&rdquo; exclaimed Sanford, his face
glowing with apparent satisfaction. &ldquo;I am delighted to
see you; for I was afraid we should never find the
ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you, indeed? Well, I had the same fear
myself. I have been looking for you ever since the
ship sailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have done our best to find the ship, Mr.
Blaine,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, of course you have; but of course, as you didn&#8217;t
find her, you were not so babyish as to sit down and
cry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; still we were very anxious to find
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Peaks says you came down from Christiania
before he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were so anxious to find the ship, that
you took a train to the interior of the country, expecting,
no doubt, to come across her on some hill, or possibly
on some of these inland lakes,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Blaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were looking for the ship&#8217;s company. We
met Scott and Laybold, who were going into the interior,
and we concluded to join them, as they wanted
to find their shipmates,&rdquo; replied Sanford, who was
now not entirely confident that &ldquo;the independent excursion
without running away&rdquo; was a success.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah! so you have picked up those two young gentlemen,
who ran away,&rdquo; added the head steward,
glancing at Scott and Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, sir; they picked us up,&rdquo; answered
the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was a mutual picking up, and we picked
each other up,&rdquo; laughed Scott. &ldquo;We knew that Sanford
and his crew were extremely anxious to find the
ship&#8217;s company, and if we joined them we should be
sure to come out right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Blaine. &ldquo;Let me see;
after our first day&#8217;s run on shore, by some mistake you
neglected to come on board at night, with the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the case exactly. The fact is, we were
too drunk to go on board with the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such was our melancholy condition, sir,&rdquo; added
Scott, shaking his head. &ldquo;We were invited, in a restaurant,
to drink &lsquo;finkel,&rsquo; and not knowing what finkel
was, we did drink; and it boozed us exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very honest about it, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are about everything, sir. We slept at a hotel,
and when we went down to the wharf to go on board,
we learned that the ship&#8217;s company had gone to Trolldoldiddledy
Falls. As we felt pretty well, we thought
we would take a train, see a little of the inside of Sweden,
and meet the ship&#8217;s company at Squozzlebogchepping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t give you the latitude and longitude of the
jaw-breaker, but it was at the junction of the two railways,
where the party came down from the canal.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
We were sure we should find our fellows there, but
the Swedish figures bothered us, and we made a mistake
in the hour the train was due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Swedish figures are the same as ours,&rdquo;
suggested the head steward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they? Well, I don&#8217;t know what the matter
was, except that we were five minutes too late for the
train. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very unfortunate it was you lost that train!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, indeed; I couldn&#8217;t have felt any worse if I
had lost my great-grandmother, who died fifty years
before I was born. These honest fellows felt bad,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We took the next train to Gottenburg; but when
we arrived, the ship had sailed for Copenhagen, which
I was more anxious to see than any other place in
Northern Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for that reason you came on to Stockholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; you are too fast, Mr. Blaine. Your consequent
does not agree with the antecedent. There
was no steamer for Copenhagen for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a steamer within an hour after you
reached Gottenburg in that train, and an hour before
the sailing of the canal steamer; and Mr. Peaks went
down in her,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We knew of no steamer till Monday, and we were
afraid, if we went in her, that we should be too late to
join the ship in Copenhagen; and with heroic self-denial,
we abandoned our fondly-cherished hope of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
seeing the capital of Denmark, and hastened on to
Stockholm, so as to be sure and not miss the ship
again. These honest fellows,&rdquo; said Scott, pointing to
Sanford and his companions, &ldquo;agreed with us that
this was the only safe course to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that you struggled very violently to join
your ship, and I only wonder that such superhuman
efforts should have failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have not failed, sir,&rdquo; protested Scott. &ldquo;The
ship will come here, and we will join her then, or
perish in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid some untoward event will
defeat your honest intentions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they are defeated it will not be our fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not; but whom have you there?&rdquo;
inquired the head steward, for the first time observing
Ole, who had pressed forward to hear Scott&#8217;s remarks.
&ldquo;Ole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; that&#8217;s the valiant Ole, of Norway,&rdquo; replied
the joker.</p>

<p>His presence was satisfactorily explained by the
coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you desire to leave the ship, Ole? Didn&#8217;t
we use you well?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed, sir; but I was bashful, and did
not wish to see some people in Christiansand,&rdquo; replied
the waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole evaded all inquiries, as he had a dozen times
before, and declined to explain anything relating to
his past history. Mr. Blaine said he had heard the
party had taken the canal steamer, and he immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
proceeded to Stockholm by railroad. He at once
telegraphed to Mr. Lowington at Copenhagen, that
he had found all the absentees, and asked for instructions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a go, and the game is up,&rdquo; said Sanford, in
a whisper, when he met Stockwell alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so; what will he do with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know; I rather like this mode of travelling.
But we are caught now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; we may find some way out of it.
According to Blaine&#8217;s cue we are to be regarded as
runaways. If that is the case, I don&#8217;t join the ship
this summer,&rdquo; said Stockwell, very decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>Before dark, Mr. Blaine received a despatch from
the principal, directing him to take the next train
to Malm&ouml;, which is the town in Sweden opposite Copenhagen.
The head steward did not communicate
its contents to his charge that night, but he called all
of them at four o&#8217;clock the next morning, and by good
management on his part, they were on the train
which left Stockholm at six o&#8217;clock. At Katherineholm,
where the party ate an excellent breakfast, Mr.
Blaine unhappily missed three of his company.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>UP THE BALTIC.</strong></p>


<p>The excursionists of the squadron slept soundly
after their trip to Elsinore, and Clyde Blacklock,
true to the promise he had made to himself, kept
awake to watch his chances to escape. Not a sound
was to be heard in the ship, and the intense silence
was even more trying to the prisoner in the brig than
the noise and bustle of the whole crew when awake.
Ryder, the fourth lieutenant, and two seamen had the
anchor watch on deck. Each officer served two hours,
and was required at the stroke of the bell, every half
hour, to walk through the steerage, where no light was
permitted after nine o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Clyde took the saw from its hiding-place under the
stairs, and commenced work on one of the slats. The
instrument was very sharp, but the noise it made
promised to betray him, and he was obliged to use it
with extreme caution. Bracing the slat with one
shoulder, he worked the saw very slowly, so that the
wood should not vibrate. The process was very slow,
and twice he was obliged to conceal his saw and lie
down on the bed at the approach of the officer of the
watch. After working more than an hour, he succeeded
in cutting off one of the slats, just far enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
above the deck to avoid the nails with which it was
secured. But it was fastened at the top as well as at
the bottom, and when he pulled it in to wrench it from
its position, it creaked horribly, and he was obliged to
labor with it another half hour, before he could pull
it in far enough to permit his exit. In the middle of
the operation he was obliged to restore it partly to its
position, and lie down again, to escape the observation
of the officer of the anchor watch.</p>

<p>His care and patience were finally successful, though,
if the sleepers around him had not been very tired,
some of them must have been disturbed even by the
little noise he made. The removal of the single slat
gave him an opening of about nine inches, which was
narrow even for him; but he contrived to work himself
through it. Putting the slat back into its original
position, and wedging it down with a copper, so that
the means of his escape might not readily be seen, he
crept carefully forward to the ladder under the forecastle,
where he paused to consider the means by
which he should escape from the vessel. He began
to realize that this was a more difficult matter than
getting out of the brig. He knew that the anchor
watch consisted of an officer and two seamen.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of the matter, eight bells
struck; and he was aware that the watch was changed
at this hour. Retiring to the kitchen to wait for a
more favorable moment, he heard the two seamen
come down the ladder to call the relief. As they entered
one of the mess-rooms, he ran up the ladder,
and concealed himself under the top-gallant forecastle.
In a few moments he heard the relief on deck, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
from his hiding-place saw the officer on the quarter-deck
with a lantern in his hand. The two seamen
took their places on the top-gallant forecastle, where
they could see the entire deck, and any boat or vessel
that approached the ship.</p>

<p>Clyde did not regard the situation as very hopeful.
The night was chilly, and he did not feel at all inclined
to swim ashore, which he had intended to do,
as a last resort. The boats were all hoisted up at the
davits, as if to provide for just such cases as his own.
He listened with interest to the conversation of the
watch above him; but he could not identify their
voices, and was unable to determine whether it was
safe for him to address them. In fact he was unable
to determine upon anything, and bell after bell struck
without finding him any better prepared to make a
move. At four bells, or two o&#8217;clock in the morning,
the watch was relieved again, and Clyde remained in
the same unsettled state of mind. But when the two
seamen went below to call the relief, he changed his
position, crawling into the waist, where he disposed
himself under the lee of the rail. Over his head was
the fourth cutter, one of the smallest of the boats.</p>

<p>Clyde could see the dark form of the officer walking
to and fro on the quarter-deck, and his presence
was not favorable to any movement. He found the
cleats where the falls of the boat were made fast, and
he was considering the practicability of casting them
off, letting the cutter drop into the water, and then
sliding down on a rope. The officer of the anchor
watch seemed to be the only obstacle in his way. He
began to experiment with the falls. Casting off one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
them, he carefully let the rope slip over the cleat till
he had lowered the bow of the cutter about two feet.
He repeated the operation upon the stern fall. He let
off the rope so gradually that the noise did not attract
the attention of any of the watch.</p>

<p>Five bells struck, and the officer descended to the
steerage. While he was absent, Clyde dropped each
end of the boat about four feet more, and then coiled
himself away until the officer had returned to his station.
But it was nearly daylight, and he was compelled to
hurry on with his work. Little by little he let out the
falls, till the fourth cutter floated in the water. When
the officer went below, at six bells, he climbed upon
the rail, and slid down on the bow fall into the boat.
Casting off the falls, he pushed the cutter astern of the
ship, and for the first time began to feel as though he
were free. He was afraid to use an oar, lest the noise
should attract the attention of the watch on deck. He
felt that he had managed his escape with exceeding
cleverness, and was unwilling to risk anything now in
the moment of success. The wind carried the boat
clear of the ship, and he lay down in the stern sheets,
so that if the officer on the quarter-deck discovered
the cutter, he might suppose no one was in her.</p>

<p>He had occupied this position but a moment before
he heard a rushing noise near him, and, raising his
head, discovered a small schooner, under full sail,
headed directly upon him. He had hardly time to
stand up before the bow of the vessel was within his
reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; shouted he, in terror, for the thought of
being carried under the keel of the schooner was appalling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
But the cutter was crowded aside by the vessel, and
Clyde sprang upon her deck, while his boat went
astern of her.</p>

<p>Too late, the schooner luffed up, and Clyde seated
himself on the rail to catch his breath. Two men
came to him, and spoke in Norwegian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak English,&rdquo; replied Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are English?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&#8217;t speak anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak English,&rdquo; replied the skipper, as he went
back to the helm, and Clyde followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound?&rdquo; asked the runaway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Stockholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Danish, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Norwegian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to Stockholm with you, and pay my passage,
if you like,&rdquo; added Clyde, who wished to get as
far as possible from the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall, if you like; or you shall work, if you
please. I lose a young sailor, and I want another, to
work in his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I will go as a passenger, or not at all,&rdquo; replied
Clyde, very decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you do in a boat so late in the night?&rdquo; asked
the skipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going on shore to find a steamer for Stockholm.
I will pay you twenty species for my passage,&rdquo;
added the runaway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind to pay so much. You shall
have my berth; but it will be long time to Stockholm
in my vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
&ldquo;No matter; I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall pick up the boat you lose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; never mind the boat,&rdquo; answered Clyde, impatiently,
as he glanced at the ship.</p>

<p>The captain questioned him about the boat more
particularly; but the fugitive gave such answers as he
pleased. Though the skipper was very rough and
savage to the two men who formed his crew, he
treated his passenger at first with much consideration.
The little cabin of the schooner was a nasty hole, and
if Clyde had not been very sleepy, he could hardly
have closed his eyes there; but before the vessel was
out of sight of Copenhagen, his slumber was deep and
heavy.</p>

<p>The shout of the fugitive when he was in danger of
being run down had been heard by the officer on the
quarter-deck of the Young America. He saw the
collision, and discovered the cutter when it went astern
of the vessel; but he did not suspect that it belonged
to the ship. The schooner filled away on her course
again, after she had luffed up, and the boat was adrift.
He deemed it his duty to secure it before it was stove
by some early steamer from Malm&ouml;, or elsewhere, and
calling the two seamen, he directed them to lower the
fourth cutter. But the fourth cutter was already lowered,
and the officer began to think that the boat adrift
was the missing one. The third cutter, therefore, was
used, and when the two seamen had pulled off in her,
the officer went below and called Peaks.</p>

<p>The boatswain took his lantern, and went to the
brig, as soon as he was told that the fourth cutter was
adrift. The bird had flown. The door was secure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
and all the slats were apparently in their place; but
the appearance of a small quantity of saw-dust indicated
where the breach had been made. A little pressure
forced in the sawn slat, and Peaks understood
why the prisoner had only desired to be left alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you all asleep on deck?&rdquo; asked Peaks of
the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I have not been asleep on duty,&rdquo; replied
Beckwith, the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&#8217;t you see him lower the boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see how it was done, then,&rdquo; added Peaks.
&ldquo;But where is the prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. I suppose he went on board that
small schooner that run down the cutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beckwith pointed to a sail headed to the south-east,
which was just visible in the faint light of the early
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is out of our reach for the present,&rdquo; said Peaks,
in utter disgust, as he descended the steps to the main
cabin.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was informed of the escape of Clyde,
but no steamer could be obtained at that early hour to
chase the schooner, and the matter was permitted to
rest as it was. When all hands turned out in the
morning, a strict investigation was made; but no one
who had served on the anchor watch was able to give
any information. No one had seen the boat lowered,
and no one had heard the saw. Peaks went on shore,
and ascertained that the Norwegian schooner Rensdyr
had sailed at an early hour. She had cleared for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Stockholm, and was doubtless on her way there. The
principal was so much interested in the fate of Clyde,
or rather in his reformation, that he determined to follow
up the fugitive. The English steamer Newsky,
from London to Stockholm, was then in port, and
when she sailed that day, Peaks was sent in her to intercept
the runaway on his arrival at Stockholm.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Mr. Andersen came on board, inspected
the ship, and witnessed some of the evolutions
in seamanship, which included the manning of the
yards in honor of his visit. At the invitation of Paul
Kendall he went on board of the Grace, and took a
sail up the Sound, dining on board, and returning in
the afternoon. The students again went on shore, and
visited the Rosenberg Palace, an irregular structure of
red brick, with a high peaked roof and four towers.
Connected with it is an extensive and beautiful garden,
adorned with statues. The palace was built for
Christian IV., in 1604, but is no longer a royal residence,
being filled with various national collections of
arms, medals, and antiquities, including many historical
mementos of kings and other great men of Denmark.
Among them are the saddle, bridle, and caparisons,
the sword and pistols, presented by King Christian
IV. to his eldest son at his marriage. They are
adorned with diamonds, pearls, and gold, and cost a
million francs in Paris.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the students marched to the Palace
of Frederiksberg, whose park is a favorite resort of
the people of the city. The building contains nothing
worth seeing; indeed, portions of it have been rented
for the use of private families; but the garden is beautifully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
laid out with kiosks, bridges over the winding
canal, on which float a great number of white swans,
with little islands, studded with groves and pleasant
grassy slopes. The palace stands on the only eminence
near Copenhagen. On pleasant days, especially on
Sundays, this park is filled with family picnics, little
parties bringing their own lunch, and spending the
day in these delightful groves.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day the students wandered
over the city, each seeking what pleased him
most. When they went on board the vessels, they
were entirely satisfied with what they had seen of Copenhagen,
and were ready to visit some other city.
Very early the next morning, Mr. Blaine, with all but
three of the absentees, came on board. The head
steward told his story, and Scott and Laybold told
their story; the former, as usual, being the spokesman.
The wag told the whole truth, exactly as it was;
that they were ashamed to come on board while so
tipsy, and had missed the train at the junction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you drank any finkel since?&rdquo; asked the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not a drop. One glass was enough for
me,&rdquo; replied Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Laybold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may both return to your duty,&rdquo; added the
principal.</p>

<p>Both were astonished at being let off so easily; but
Mr. Lowington was satisfied that they spoke the truth,
and had not intended to run away. The others were
also ordered to attend to their duty, but with the intimation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
that their conduct would be investigated at
the return of Sanford and Stockwell, who, with Ole,
had left the party at Katherineholm.</p>

<p>The signal for sailing was flying on board of the
Young America, and at seven o&#8217;clock the squadron
was under way, continuing the voyage &ldquo;up the Baltic.&rdquo;
No notice seemed to be taken of the absence
of Sanford and Stockwell, but everybody believed that
the principal knew what he was about. The wind
was tolerably fresh from the west-south-west, and the
squadron made rapid progress through the water, logging
ten knots all day. The students watched with
interest the villages on the coast of Denmark, with
their sharp, red roofs, and the swarms of fishing-boats
moored in front of them. The shores of Sweden
were in sight all the time, and at three o&#8217;clock in
the afternoon land was also seen on the starboard
bow. But the masters, who were constantly watching
the chart, were not at all astonished, though the
seamen were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What land is that, Scott?&rdquo; asked Laybold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That? Why, don&#8217;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t. I know Germany is over there
somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t expect to run into it so near
Sweden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s Gabogginholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it in Germany?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it&#8217;s an island, at least a hundred and fifty
miles from Germany. The Baltic is rather a big
thing out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you remember those long names, Scott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What long names?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
&ldquo;Such as the name of that island. I couldn&#8217;t recollect
such a word ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I either. I know them by instinct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say the name of the island is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gastringumboggin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&#8217;t what you said before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve forgotten what I did say it was. You musn&#8217;t
ask me twice about a name, for I say I can&#8217;t remember,&rdquo;
laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are selling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am; and you go off cheaper than any
fellow I ever saw before. I haven&#8217;t the least idea
what the land is, except that it must be an island
not less than a hundred and fifty miles from Prussia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s Bornholm,&rdquo; said Walker, a seamen, who
had heard the name from the officers. &ldquo;It&#8217;s an island
twenty-six miles long and fifteen wide, belongs to
Denmark, and has thirty-two thousand inhabitants,
and a lot of round churches on it. That&#8217;s what the
fellows on the quarter-deck say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; replied Scott. &ldquo;You have learned
your lesson well. What is the principal town on
that island?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; answered Walker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubbenboggin,&rdquo; said Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandmother,&rdquo; laughed the wag, as he turned
on his heel, and walked away.</p>

<p>Towards night the wind subsided, and the squadron
was almost becalmed; but a light breeze sprang up
after dark, and in the morning the ship was off the
southern point of Oland, an island ninety miles long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
by ten wide, and well covered with forests. On the
narrow strait which separates it from the main land
is Calmar, a town of historic interest, in Sweden.
At noon the southern point of Gottland was seen,
and Scott insisted upon calling it &ldquo;Gabungenboggin,&rdquo;
though the real name was soon circulated. It is
eighty miles long by thirty-three wide, and contains
fifty-four thousand inhabitants. Wisby is the only
town. The island is noted for its beautiful climate,
which makes it a pleasant resort for summer tourists.</p>

<p>At sunrise on the following morning, the ship leading
the squadron was approaching the islands which
cover the entrance to the harbor of Stockholm. Pilots
were taken by the several vessels, and the fleet entered
the archipelago, through which it was to sail for thirty
miles. At first the openings were very wide, and not
much of the shore could be seen; but soon the distances
grew less, and the shores were studded with
villages and fine residences. The little steamers&mdash;some
of them not so large as the ship&#8217;s first cutter&mdash;began
to appear; and at eight o&#8217;clock the Young
America let go her anchor between Staden and Skeppsholm,
off the quay near the palace, which was crowded
with steamers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, Laybold,&rdquo; said Scott, when the sails
had been furled, and every rope coiled away in its place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so. What&#8217;s that big building on the shore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the Slottenboggin,&rdquo; laughed Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&#8217;t! You can&#8217;t sell me again with
your boggins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll bet half a pint of salt water it is the king&#8217;s
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
&ldquo;Very likely it is; and here is a fine building on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be the Wobbleboggin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t; but twig these little steamers,&rdquo;
added Scott, pointing to one of the snorting miniature
boats that plied across the arm of the sea opposite the
quay. &ldquo;The pilot and engineer, and a boy to take the
fares, seem to be the officers, crew, and all hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in some of them all hands are boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boats seemed to contain nothing but the engine
and boiler, which were in a compact mass, without
covering. All around them were seats. Forward of
the engine was a little steering-wheel, hardly more
than a foot in diameter, at which the pilot&mdash;often a
boy&mdash;was seated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a complete view of the city,&rdquo; said Captain
Lincoln, at this moment coming into the waist with
the surgeon and Norwood. &ldquo;I think I can get it
from the main cross-trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too stiff to go aloft,&rdquo; replied Dr. Winstock;
&ldquo;but I commend your plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m with you,&rdquo; added Norwood, as he followed
the captain up the main rigging.</p>

<p>From this lofty position on the cross-trees the two
officers obtained a good idea of the situation of the
city. The three islands which form the central portion
of the city lay in the strait leading to the M&auml;ler Lake.
The north and south suburbs were on each side of
it. Skeppsholm, Castellholm, and the Djurg&#259;rden&mdash;Deer
Garden&mdash;were other islands, lying nearer the
Baltic. The finest portion of the city seemed to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the northern suburbs. While they were studying the
panorama of the place, all hands were called to lecture,
and they hastened to their places in the steerage.
Professor Mapps was at his post, with the map on
the foremast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweden is called <em>Sverige</em> by the natives; La<em>
Su&egrave;de</em> by the French; <em>Schweden</em> by the Germans;
<em>La Svezia</em> by the Italians; and <em>Suecia</em> by the Spaniards.
It contains one hundred and sixty-eight thousand
square miles&mdash;a territory equal in extent to the six
New England States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
and Delaware united. Its population is a little
over four millions&mdash;about the same as that of the
State of New York. It is nearly a thousand miles
long from north to south, with an average breadth of
two hundred miles. By far the greater portion of it
is very sparsely settled, for it extends from fifty-five
degrees of north latitude up to the arctic regions. It
contains no important rivers, though its large lakes
and arms of the sea are valuable as avenues of navigation.
Over eighty lakes are mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instructer described the Wenern and Wettern
Lakes, and the G&ouml;ta Canal, which passes through
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweden is an agricultural country, and its principal
manufactures are lumber and iron. It has six
hundred and thirty-eight miles of railway, and the
steamers which you see at the quay, mostly of iron,
and built in Sweden, ply to all parts of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The average of the temperature in Stockholm is
forty-two degrees, or twenty-five degrees for winter,
and sixty-two degrees for summer. From what you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
have already seen of Sweden, I think you will consider
it very like New England. The interior has
about the same physical features, and you will see
there similar houses, barns, and fences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The government is a limited monarchy, based on
the constitution of 1809, and since amended. The
king must be a Lutheran. He has an absolute veto on
the acts of the legislature. The Diet, or Parliament,
consists of two houses, the upper of which is composed
of one hundred and twenty-seven members, or one for
every thirty thousand inhabitants. The lower house
consists of one hundred and eighty-eight members,
fifty-five of whom are elected by the towns, and the
rest by the rural districts, at the rate of one for every
forty thousand people. Property qualifications are
required for either house, and all members must be
Protestants. They are paid a salary of three hundred
and thirty-five dollars of our money, and their travelling
expenses, for the session of four months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have incidentally spoken of the history of Sweden
in connection with that of Norway and Denmark.
The kingdom was founded by Odin, and for a long
period the history of the country is a record of the
wars with Norway and Denmark, and it was finally
conquered by Margaret, and by the Union of Calmar
the three kingdoms were consolidated in 1397. It
became a Christian nation early in the eleventh century.
Sweden was doubtless the first anti-slavery
power; for, during the reign of Birger II., about 1300,
a law against the sale of slaves was enacted, with
the declaration that it was &lsquo;in the highest degree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
criminal for Christians to sell men whom Christ had
redeemed by his blood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1520 Gustavus Ericsson excited a rebellion
against Christian II., of Denmark, who had murdered
his father and many other Swedes. This revolution
was successful three years later, and its leader made
king, under the title of Gustaf I., often called Gustavus
Vasa, or Wasa. He was succeeded by his son,
and the throne continued in his family; but the next
notable sovereign was Gustaf II., or Gustavus Adolphus.
His grandfather, Gustavus Vasa, had established
the Protestant religion in Sweden; but his
nephew, Sigismond, who had been elected king of
Poland, and had become a Catholic, succeeded to the
throne. Endeavoring to change the established religion,
he was deposed, and the succession changed.
This caused a war between Sweden, and Russia, and
Poland. Gustavus was only eighteen when he came
to the throne, with this war bequeathed to him. He
was full of energy, and defeated his enemies on all
sides. Austria was the leader of the Catholic party
in Europe, which was striving to restore the papal
supremacy. Gustavus Adolphus held a similar relation
to the Protestant party. He was engaged in the
Thirty Years&#8217; War, and won many decisive victories.
He captured Munich, and overran Bavaria, but was
finally killed in the battle of L&uuml;tzen, in 1632. By
his prowess and skill he raised Sweden to the rank of
one of the first kingdoms of Europe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was succeeded by his daughter, Christina, then
only six years old. She reigned but seven years
after she became of age, abdicating in favor of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
cousin Charles X. She died in Rome, after a dissolute
and shameful life, and was interred in St. Peter&#8217;s
Church. Charles was at war with the Danes during
his brief reign, and achieved the daring military feat
of crossing the Great and Little Belts on the ice, which
enabled him to dictate his own terms of peace with
the Danes. The Swedes consider him one of their
greatest kings. His son, Charles XI., followed him,
and ruled for thirty-seven years. After a brief period
of peace, another war with Denmark ensued, which
resulted to the ultimate advantage of Sweden. This
king contrived to obtain from the Diet the gift of
absolute power, which, in the hands of his son and
successor, Charles XII., nearly ruined the nation.
Russia, Poland, and Denmark combined to rob him
of a considerable portion of his kingdom, and Charles
XII., at the age of sixteen, displayed an energy and a
skill far beyond his years. He conquered a peace
with Denmark first, and then turned his attention to
the rest of his enemies, whom he overwhelmed and
subdued. With nine thousand men he defeated a
Russian army of forty thousand, under Peter the Great,
at Narva. He vanquished the armies of Poland and
Saxony, and attempted the conquest of Russia, but
was utterly defeated in the battle of Pultowa, and
escaped into Turkish territory, where he remained for
five years. Here he brought about a war between
Turkey and Russia, and the army of the former shut
up that of Peter the Great in the Crimea. The lady
who was afterwards Catharine I. bribed the grand
vizier with all her jewels to allow the Russians to
escape, and this event utterly ruined the hopes of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
monarch of Sweden. Finally the Turks drove him
from their country, and, after various vicissitudes, he
arrived in his own, and was killed, in 1718, at Frederikhald,
in Norway. While he was away, his enemies
had been appropriating his territory, and Sweden
was reduced to a second-class power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Diet elected Ulrica Eleonora, sister of Charles,
queen, who resigned in favor of her husband, Fredrik
I. Another war with Russia followed, and
Sweden lost more of her territory. Adolf Fredrik
succeeded to the throne in 1751, who was elected by
the Diet. Still another war with Russia was carried
on during his reign. His son, Gustaf III., with the
aid of his soldiers, increased the powers of the crown;
but he was assassinated at a ball, in 1792, and his son,
Gustaf Adolf IV., came to the throne. His policy
involved the nation in a war with the allies, and he
lost Finland and Pomerania. He was so unpopular
that he was compelled to abdicate, and his uncle,
Charles XIII., was raised to the throne in 1809. He
had no children, and the Prince of Holstein-Augustenburg
was elected as his successor; but he was assassinated,
and one of Napoleon&#8217;s generals, Bernadotte,
was chosen crown prince, and in 1818 he succeeded
to the throne as Charles XIV. His reign was a successful
one, and his efforts to secure Norway to his
adopted country made him popular even before he
was king. He espoused the cause of the allies against
Napoleon, and was well cared for by them when the
affairs of Europe were finally settled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His son Oscar was his heir, and came to the
throne at the death of his father in 1844. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
followed by his son, Charles XV., the present king,
in 1859.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The army organization is similar to that of Denmark,
and about one hundred and fifty thousand men
are available for service. The navy contains four
monitors on the American plan, which were invented
by John Ericsson, a Swede, two iron-clad gunboats,
twenty-one steamers, and sixteen sailing vessels, besides
a great number of floating batteries, and other
stationary craft. Although only about six thousand
sailors are actually in the navy, nearly thirty thousand
can be had in case of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor finished his lecture, and the students
hastened on deck, to see more of the sights which
surrounded them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE CRUISE IN THE LITTLE STEAMER.</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the use, Stockwell?&rdquo; said Sanford, as
the absentees seated themselves on the train
for Malm&ouml;, under the charge of the head steward.
&ldquo;Blaine got his despatch from the principal last night,
but he didn&#8217;t say a word to us till this morning.
He&#8217;s playing a sharp game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so,&rdquo; replied Stockwell. &ldquo;He don&#8217;t mean
to trust us out of sight again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t say a word to any fellow,&rdquo; whispered the
coxswain. &ldquo;You and I will fight it out on our own
hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. It is plain enough that Blaine
regards us as runaways, and I suppose the principal
will do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely; and when we get to Russia, all we
shall have to do will be to count our fingers in the
steerage, while the rest of the fellows are seeing the Russians,&rdquo;
continued Sanford, who now appeared to regard
&ldquo;the independent excursion without running away&rdquo;
as a failure. &ldquo;We shall not even see anything more
of Stockholm. I don&#8217;t like the idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo; asked
Stockwell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
&ldquo;At the first chance we will leave this train, and
make our way back to Stockholm,&rdquo; whispered Sanford.
&ldquo;There is a steamer to St. Petersburg twice
a week, and we have money enough to carry us
through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right; I am with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take Ole, if you like, to do the talking
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train stopped at Katherineholm about half past
nine. The boys had taken nothing but the Swedish
early breakfast of coffee and a biscuit, and the head
steward allowed them to have a more substantial
meal, each paying for himself. They entered the restaurant,
where, on a large table in the centre of the
room, were great dishes of broiled salmon and veal
cutlets, with high piles of plates near them. Each
passenger helped himself at these dishes, and then
seated himself at one of the little tables. When he
had finished his salmon, he helped himself to veal
cutlets; beer and coffee were served by the waiters.
Sanford and Stockwell hurried through the meal, and
went to the counter where the woman received payment.
She asked them some question and they
were obliged to call Ole, to know what she said. She
asked if they had had beer or coffee, which was extra, the
meal being one and a half rix dalers. She gave them
a tin check; for at this place they seemed to be sharper
than the Swedes usually are, and the check was to
enable them to get out of the restaurant. A man at
the door received it, and no one was allowed to pass
without it; and thus none could leave without paying
for the meal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
&ldquo;Finished your breakfast, Ole?&rdquo; said Sanford,
carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and that salmon was very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First rate. Come with us, Ole,&rdquo; added the coxswain,
as he led the way out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>The trio entered the station, and as no one followed
them, they left by the front door. Dodging behind the
buildings, they soon cleared the station. Taking the
public road, they walked for half an hour at a rapid
pace, and then halted to consider the situation. The
train had gone, for they had heard its departure; but
whether Mr. Blaine had gone or not was an open
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said Sanford, as he seated himself at
the side of the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the train back to Stockholm,&rdquo; replied Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Blaine did not go on, after he missed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he did. But whether he did or not,
the train has gone, and he cannot take us to Copenhagen.
If we find him at the station, why, we took a
little walk, and lost the train, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s played out,&rdquo; replied Sanford. &ldquo;We have
missed the train too many times, already. What time
does the next one return to Stockholm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s go back to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This course was adopted, and on their arrival they
learned that they could return to Stockholm at half
past two in the afternoon. The man in charge said
that the gentleman with the young men had been looking
for them. Sanford replied, through Ole, that
they had lost the train, but would return to Stockholm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and start again the next morning. After dining
in the restaurant, the runaways&mdash;as they certainly
were now, if not before&mdash;departed, and arrived at
their destination in about three hours. They immediately
went to the office on the quay, and learned that a
steamer would leave for St. Petersburg at two o&#8217;clock
on Friday morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we engage places now?&rdquo; asked Sanford,&mdash;for
the clerk in charge spoke English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take three places in one room,&rdquo; added
the coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you passports?&rdquo; asked the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot sell you tickets then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without passports?&rdquo; exclaimed Sanford, appalled
at this new difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; and passports must be <em>vis&eacute;</em> by the Russian
consul before we can issue a ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are down then,&rdquo; added the coxswain. &ldquo;My
passport is on board of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So is mine,&rdquo; added Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I never had any,&rdquo; said Ole.</p>

<p>The party left the steamer&#8217;s office, and were unable
to devise any means of overcoming the obstacle. They
went to the Hotel Rydberg again, and consulted the
porter, who had been very kind to them before.
This functionary is entirely different in European
hotels from those of the same name in the United
States. He stands at the entrance, usually dressed in
uniform, to answer all inquiries of guests, and to do
all that is required of the clerks in American hotels.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
He assured the anxious inquirers that, even if they
got into Russia, their passports would be immediately
demanded, and that no one could remain in any city
there over night without one. The American minister
in Stockholm would give them the required
documents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Ole, here, is a Norwegian,&rdquo; suggested Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter. Have him put into your passport as
your courier or servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; we will see him to-morrow,&rdquo; replied
the coxswain; and the problem seemed to be solved.</p>

<p>The next day they went to the American legation,
but the minister had gone to Upsala for a week, and
the secretary declined to issue the passports, because
the boys could not prove that they were citizens of the
United States. Vexed and discouraged, they wandered
about the city till Friday noon, when an English
steamer came into port. They stood on the quay,
watching the movements of the passengers as they
landed. They had almost concluded to take a steamer
to Stettin, L&uuml;beck, or some other port in Germany; but
Russia was a strange land, and they were not willing
to abandon the idea of seeing its sights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether this steamer goes any farther,&rdquo;
said Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; added Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she goes to St. Petersburg. It may be
her officers are not so particular about the confounded
passports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&#8217;t stay in Russia over night without
one, even if you get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
&ldquo;The American minister will fit us out with them.
I expect to find a letter of credit in St. Petersburg,
and that will prove that I am an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go on board of the steamer and ascertain
where she is going,&rdquo; continued Sanford, as he led the
way across the plank, which had been extended from
the deck to the stone pier.</p>

<p>The boys went upon the hurricane deck, where
they had seen an officer who looked as though he
might be the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you go to St. Petersburg, captain?&rdquo; asked the
coxswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we return to London, touching only at Copenhagen,&rdquo;
replied the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said a tall man, who had followed the
runaways up the steps from the lower deck. &ldquo;But
you are not going to St. Petersburg without the rest
of us&mdash;are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford was startled, and turning sharp around,
saw Peaks, who had come out of the cabin as the boys
stepped on board. He had followed them to the hurricane
deck, and suspecting that something was wrong,
he had waited till the coxswain&#8217;s question betrayed
their intention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we are not going to St. Petersburg; we are
waiting for the ship,&rdquo; replied Sanford, recovering his
self-possession in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you are? All right, then. But the last I heard
of you was, that you were all on your way to Copenhagen
to join the ship,&rdquo; added the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we were, Mr. Peaks; but after we had taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
breakfast at a station on the railroad, we went to have
a little walk, and see something of the country. We
thought we had time enough, but the train&mdash;confound
it!&mdash;went off without us. We were terribly provoked,
but we couldn&#8217;t help ourselves, you know; so we
made our way back to this city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must have been very badly provoked,&rdquo;
said Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we were,&mdash;honor bright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you thought you would go over to St. Petersburg
before the ship arrived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; we had no idea of going to St.
Petersburg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&#8217;s the reason you asked whether this
steamer was going there,&mdash;because you hadn&#8217;t any
idea of going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know very well that we can&#8217;t go to St. Petersburg
without our passports, which are on board of the
ship,&rdquo; protested Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand; but who is this?&rdquo; asked
Peaks, as he glanced at Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s Ole Amundsen; don&#8217;t you remember
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do. And he is on a lark with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not on a lark. We have been trying with
all our might to find the ship, for the last fortnight;
and we are bound to do so, or die in the attempt,&rdquo; said
Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Ole has been with you all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; we couldn&#8217;t have done anything without
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would have been on board the ship long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
ago, if you hadn&#8217;t had him to speak the lingo for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we tell you our story, you will see that we
have done our best to find the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know that I care to hear any more of your
story; it&#8217;s too much story for me, and you can tell it
to Mr. Lowington, who will be here by to-morrow,
I think. Very likely you can take me to a good
hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; we are staying at the Hotel Rydberg,
which is the best in Stockholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heave ahead, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The runaways led the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you talk the Swedish lingo, Ole?&rdquo; asked the
boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you stow yourself, when we went into
Christiansand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second cutter, sir,&rdquo; replied the waif,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; you were to go with her crew when
they left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I didn&#8217;t know a single one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you hide for, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&#8217;t want the pilot to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the boatswain.</p>

<p>But this was as far as Ole would go in that direction.
Neither man nor boy could extort from him the
secret he so persistently retained. A short walk
brought the party to the Hotel Rydberg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This gentleman wants a room,&rdquo; said Sanford to
the porter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
&ldquo;No. 29,&rdquo; said the man, calling a servant. &ldquo;Did
you get your passports, young men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford drew back, and made energetic signs to the
porter to keep still; but the official failed to understand
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they haven&#8217;t got them yet,&rdquo; replied Peaks.
&ldquo;The fact is, all the passports are on board the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the young gentlemen were very anxious to
obtain new ones, so that they could go to St. Petersburg.
They intended to leave by this morning&#8217;s
steamer, but no tickets can be had without passports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Sanford and Stockwell shook their heads to
the stupid porter, who was remarkably intelligent on
all other points; but somehow he did not see them, or
could not comprehend them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s too bad about those passports&mdash;isn&#8217;t it, my
lads?&rdquo; laughed Peaks, turning to the runaways.
&ldquo;Here&#8217;s more proof that you hadn&#8217;t the least idea of
going to St. Petersburg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry for the young gentlemen, and did
the best I could for them,&rdquo; added the gentlemanly
porter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt you did; and I&#8217;m very much obliged to
you for the trouble you took,&rdquo; replied the good-natured
boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 29, sir?&rdquo; interposed the servant, with the key
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, my hearty. But, young gentlemen, I want
to save you from any more terrible disappointments
and awful vexations in finding the ship. I&#8217;m going
up to my bunk, and if I don&#8217;t find you here when I
come down, I shall call on the American consul, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
ask him to put the police on your track. You shall
find the ship this time, or perish in the attempt, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a go!&rdquo; exclaimed Stockwell, as the servant
conducted the boatswain up the stairs to his
chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say anything to him about the passports
for?&rdquo; snapped Sanford to the porter.</p>

<p>The official in uniform by this time understood the
matter, and apologized, promising to make it all right
with the tall gentleman, and to swear that not a word
had been said to him or any one else about passports.
It was his business to please everybody, and his perquisites
depended upon his skill in doing so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Peaks mean about police?&rdquo; said Sanford,
as the trio seated themselves near the front door
of the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means what he says; confound him, he always
does!&rdquo; replied Stockwell. &ldquo;He intends to treat
us as runaway seamen, and have us arrested if we
attempt to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are trapped,&rdquo; muttered Sanford. &ldquo;What&#8217;s
Peaks doing up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know, unless he is looking for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference now. We are caught, and
we may as well make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all up with us,&rdquo; added the coxswain. &ldquo;Peaks
knows what he is about, and there isn&#8217;t much chance
of getting the weather-gage of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatswain came down in a short time. He was
cool and good-natured, and knew exactly how to deal
with the parties in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, young gentlemen, if you are going to Russia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
don&#8217;t let me detain you. If you wish to go any
where else, I shall not meddle myself. I shall let the
American consul attend to the matter. I have business
here, and I can&#8217;t keep an eye on you. But if you
want to be fair and square, and not break your hearts
because you can&#8217;t find the ship, just be in sight when
I want to know where you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be right on your heels all the time, Mr.
Peaks. If you don&#8217;t object, we will go with you.
We know the way round Stockholm, and will help
you all we can,&rdquo; said Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s sensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will show you out to the Djurgarden,&rdquo; added
Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the shows. I want Ole to talk for me,
and I don&#8217;t object to your company,&rdquo; replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the porter, presenting
himself to Peaks at this moment. &ldquo;I made a bad mistake.
It was not these young gentlemen who wanted
the passports. It was another party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I understand,&rdquo; replied the boatswain,
turning to the boys with a significant smile on his
bronzed face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were waiting for you, and were very anxious
to join their ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very kind of them to wait for me, when
they hadn&#8217;t the least idea I was coming. All right,
my hearty; you needn&#8217;t trouble yourself to smooth it
over. How much did you pay him for those lies,
Sanford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a cent, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never mind; don&#8217;t bother your heads any more
about it. I understand the matter now as well as I
shall after you have explained it for a week,&rdquo; answered
Peaks, as he left the hotel, followed by the discomfited
trio.</p>

<p>The boatswain did not deem it expedient to explain
to them his business in Stockholm. He found people
enough who spoke English, so that he was able to
dispense with the services of Ole as interpreter. He
ascertained that no such vessel as the Rensdyr had
yet arrived, and satisfied with this information, he
went out to the Djurgarden with his charge, dined
at Hasselbacken, and made himself quite comfortable.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, with Ole&#8217;s assistance,
he chartered one of the little steamers, which
was about the size of the ship&#8217;s second cutter, and,
taking the trio with him, sailed out towards the
Baltic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Mr. Peaks?&rdquo; asked Sanford,
deeply mystified by the movements of the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going to make a trip down to the Baltic, to
see what I can see,&rdquo; replied Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going for the fun of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends upon how you view it. I suppose
you are going for the fun of it, whether I am or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we would like to know what is up,&rdquo; added
Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen should not be inquisitive,&rdquo;
laughed the old salt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
&ldquo;Because, if you are going out to meet the ship, in
order to put us on board&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not going for any such purpose,&rdquo; interposed
the boatswain. &ldquo;I shouldn&#8217;t take all that trouble on
your account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s my affair, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t mean to give you any trouble on our
account,&rdquo; said Sanford, who could not readily dispossess
himself of the belief that the expedition was to
put his party on board of the ship when she hove in
sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&#8217;t, my tender lambs. You have
been so anxious to find the ship, and get on board,
it would be cruel to suspect you of any mischief,&rdquo;
laughed Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, honor bright, Mr. Peaks, whatever we intended,
we are ready now to do just what you say, and
return to the ship as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are all nice boys. You have had a good time,
and I think you ought to be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are satisfied; but I suppose we shall have no
liberty again, after we go on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will; the principal isn&#8217;t hard with
the boys when they come right square up to the mark;
but you can&#8217;t humbug him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, honestly, Mr. Peaks, we tried to find the ship,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, lads,&rdquo; interposed the boatswain, &ldquo;I
don&#8217;t believe you will have any liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you want to humbug the principal; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
me, too&mdash;but that&#8217;s no account. If you want to make
the best of it, toe the mark. Don&#8217;t have any lies in
your heart or on your tongue. Tell the whole truth,
and you will make more by it; but tell the truth whether
you make anything or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&#8217;t believe anything we say,&rdquo; protested
Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I won&#8217;t, when you are lying. I call
things by their right names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t stave the boat at Christiansand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did,&rdquo; replied Peaks, plumply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think so, it&#8217;s no use talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; don&#8217;t talk, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford was not prepared for so grave a charge as
that of causing the accident to the second cutter; and
if the principal was of the same mind as the boatswain,
the case would go hard with the runaways. The coxswain
and Stockwell went into the bow of the little
steamer to discuss their situation, which they did very
earnestly for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s the ship!&rdquo; exclaimed Sanford, as he identified
the Young America, half a mile distant, leading
the squadron into the harbor of Stockholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is; now we are in for it. Peaks has come
out here with us to make sure that we don&#8217;t get away
from him,&rdquo; added Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known as much last night as I know now,
I would have cleared out, in spite of consul and police.
If we are to be charged with smashing the second cutter,
we shall not go on shore again this summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s so. But this boat is not headed for the
ship. Peaks don&#8217;t see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, he does; there isn&#8217;t a craft of any sort within
five miles of us that he don&#8217;t see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s the ship, Mr. Peaks,&rdquo; shouted Stockwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the boatswain continued on his course, paying
no attention to the ship. The squadron disappeared
among the islands, and the steamer went out into the
Baltic, keeping well in towards the shore. When any
small schooner appeared, he ran up and examined her
very carefully, overhauling three in this manner in the
course of the forenoon. At noon the boatswain piped
all hands to dinner, for he had procured a supply of
provisions at the hotel. Though he had chartered the
steamer with Ole acting as an interpreter, he gave no
hint of his plans or purposes. He made signs to the
helmsman where to go, and occasionally gave directions
through Ole.</p>

<p>The fourth small schooner that he examined proved
to be the Rensdyr, and Peaks identified her by seeing
Clyde Blacklock, who stood on the forecastle, looking
out for the approaches to Stockholm. Possibly he
had seen the Young America, which passed the schooner,
though a mile distant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay her alongside that small vessel,&rdquo; said Peaks
to Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one!&rdquo; exclaimed Ole, whose brown face
seemed to grow pale, as he looked at the Rensdyr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s what I say, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waif actually trembled; but he spoke to the
helmsman, who immediately put the boat about, and
headed her towards Stockholm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peaks, sternly. &ldquo;That vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to her, and Ole spoke again to the steersman,
but without any better result. The boatswain
was not to be thwarted. Going forward, he took the
little wheel into his own hands, and headed the
steamer towards the Rensdyr. Indicating by his signs
what he wanted, the man at the helm seemed to be
quite willing to obey orders when he knew what was
wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t go to that vessel, Mr. Peaks,&rdquo; cried Ole, in
an agony of terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my lad, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the Rensdyr!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will kill me,&rdquo; groaned Ole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Olaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who&#8217;s he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the captain of the Rensdyr. He will kill
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won&#8217;t, my hearty. You shall have fair
play. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My step-father, Olaf Petersen. He beat me and
starved me, and I ran away from the Rensdyr in the
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, ho! The story is out&mdash;is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the whole truth, sir; it is, Mr. Peaks,&rdquo; protested
Ole. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t go to her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you be alarmed. You shall have fair
play,&rdquo; added the stout boatswain, as the steamer ran
alongside the schooner, and the man at the bow made
her fast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Peaks was on her deck in another instant, and had
Clyde by the collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you, my lad,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; cried the Briton, who had not
recognized his tyrant till he was in his grasp, for the
simple reason that he did not expect to see him at that
time and place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use to kick or yell, my jolly Briton. I never
let go,&rdquo; added the boatswain.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a yell from the steamer.
Captain Olaf no sooner discovered his lost step-son,
than he sprang upon him like a tiger. Ole howled
in his terror. Peaks dragged Clyde on board the
steamer, and tossing him on the seat at the stern, turned
his attention to the skipper of the schooner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady! hold up, my hearty,&rdquo; said he, pulling the
old Norwegian from his prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy! My son! He steal my boat, and leave
me,&rdquo; said Olaf, furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says you didn&#8217;t treat him well; that you starved
and beat him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll bet Ole told the truth,&rdquo; interposed Clyde, who
seemed suddenly to have laid aside his wrath. &ldquo;Captain
Olaf is a brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&#8217;s that, my lad? Do you know anything
about it?&rdquo; asked Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the skipper is the ugliest man I ever met
in my life,&rdquo; answered Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you except me, my bold Briton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I paid my passage, and haven&#8217;t had enough to
eat to keep soul and body together. Besides that, he
tried to make me work, and I did do some things. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
I had been obliged to stay on board another day, I
should have jumped overboard,&rdquo; continued Clyde. &ldquo;I
begin to think I was a fool for leaving the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I began to think so at the first of it,&rdquo; added Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole is my son; I must have him,&rdquo; growled the
skipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with Ole; he may go where
he pleases,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>

<p>Olaf spoke to his step-son in his own language, and
for a few moments the dialogue between them was
very violent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cast off, forward, there; give them the Swedish
of that, Ole,&rdquo; shouted Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I go on board of the Rensdyr?&rdquo; asked the
trembling waif.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do just as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall stay, and go to the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he shall not; he shall come with me,&rdquo; said
Olaf, making a spring at Ole.</p>

<p>But Peaks, who had promised to see fair play, interfered,
and with no more force than was necessary,
compelled the skipper to return to the schooner. The
steamer shoved off, and amid the fierce yells of Olaf,
steamed towards Stockholm. As she went on her
way, Ole told his story. At the death of his father,
who was the master of a small vessel, he had gone to
England with a gentleman who had taken a fancy to
him, and worked there a year. The next summer he
had accompanied his employer in an excursion through
Norway, and found his mother had married Olaf Petersen.
She prevailed upon him to leave his master,
and he went to sea with her husband. Then his mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
died, and the skipper abused him to such a degree,
that he determined to leave the vessel. Olaf had
twice brought him back, and then watched him so
closely, that he could find no opportunity to repeat the
attempt when the Rensdyr was in port.</p>

<p>On the day before the ship had picked him up, Olaf
had thrashed him soundly, and had refused to let him
have his supper. Olaf and his man drank too much
finkel that night, and left Ole at the helm. Early in the
evening, he lashed the tiller, and taking to the boat, with
the north star for his guide, pulled towards the coast
of Norway. Before morning he was exhausted with
hunger and fatigue. He had lost one oar while asleep,
and the other was a broken one. At daylight he saw
nothing of the Rensdyr, and feeling tolerably safe, had
gone to sleep again, when he was awakened by the
hail from the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you leave the ship?&rdquo; asked Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was afraid of the pilot. I thought he and
other people would make me go back to Olaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olaf has no claim upon you. He is neither your
father nor your guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was your vessel bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Bremen, where she expected to get a cargo for
Copenhagen. I suppose she found another cargo there
for Stockholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t blame you, Ole, for leaving him,&rdquo; said
Clyde. &ldquo;Olaf is the worst man I ever saw. When
he got drunk, he abused me and the men. I had
to keep out of his way, or I believe he would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
killed me, though I was a passenger, and paid my
fare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, the little steamer
ran alongside the ship, and the party went on board,
though the principal and all the officers and crew were
on shore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>STOCKHOLM AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.</strong></p>


<p>After the professor&#8217;s lecture on board of the
ship, the students were piped to dinner. According
to his usual custom, Paul Kendall, with his
lady, took rooms at the hotel, and in this instance his
example was followed by Shuffles. Dr. Winstock
and Captain Lincoln had already accepted an invitation
from Paul to spend the afternoon with him in a
ride through the city; and as soon as the boats landed
at the quay, they hastened to keep the appointment,
while the students scattered all over the city to take a
general view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Paul, how do you find the hotel?&rdquo; asked the
doctor, when the party were seated in the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good; it is one of the best hotels I have
seen in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has an excellent location, but I think there was
no such hotel when I was here before, and I staid at
the H&ouml;tel Kung Carl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a bath-house,&rdquo; said the <em>commissionnaire</em>,
as the carriage turned the corner at the hotel, and he
pointed to a large, square building, with a court-yard
in the middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks well for the cleanliness of the people,
if they support such fine establishments as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
&ldquo;Three classes of baths, sir,&rdquo; added M&ouml;ller, the
guide. &ldquo;In the first class you have a dressing-room,
and an attendant to scrub you, and showers, douches,
and everything of the sort. This is Drottninggatan,
the principal street of the city,&rdquo; added the man, as
the carriage turned into another street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, Queen Street,&rdquo; explained the
surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather a narrow street for the principal one,&rdquo;
said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the streets of Stockholm are narrow, or nearly
all; and very few of them have sidewalks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This street looks very much like the streets at
home. The shops are about the same thing. There&#8217;s
a woman in a queer dress,&rdquo; added Captain Lincoln.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a Dalecarlian woman. They used to row
the boats about the waters of the city, coming down
from Dalecarlia to spend the summer here; but the
little steamers have taken the business all away from
them. They hired a boat for the season, and paid
the owner one half of the fares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their costume is rather picturesque,&rdquo; added
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that woman is far from handsome,&rdquo; laughed
Mrs. Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of them are pretty,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>The dress was a rather short petticoat, with a fanciful
bodice, in which red predominated. Quite a
number of them were seen by the party during their
stay in Stockholm, but all of them had coarse features
and clumsy forms.</p>

<p>The carriage returned to the centre of the city by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
another street, passing through Carl XIII. Torg, or
square, where stands the statue of that king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the Caf&eacute; Blanche, where they have music
every afternoon in summer, with beer, coffee, and
other refreshments. The Swedes are very fond of
these gardens,&rdquo; said M&ouml;ller. &ldquo;Here is the Hotel Rydberg.
This is Gustaf Adolf Torget, and that is his
statue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge to the little island in the stream,
the carriage stopped, to enable the party to look
down into the garden, which is called Str&ouml;mparterren,
where a band plays, and refreshments are dispensed
in the warm evenings of summer. Passing the immense
palace, the tourists drove along the Skeppsbron,
or quay, which is the principal landing-place of
the steamers. Crossing another bridge over the south
stream, or outlet of Lake M&auml;ler, they entered the
southern suburb of the city, called S&ouml;dermalm. Ascending
to the highest point of land, the party were
conducted to the roof of a house, where a magnificent
view of the city and its surroundings was obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will sit down here and rest a while,&rdquo; said the
doctor, suiting the action to the words. &ldquo;This promontory,
or some other one near it, was formerly called
Agne&#8217;s Rock, and there is a story connected with it.
Agne was the king of Sweden about 220 B.C. In a
war with the Finns, he killed their king, and captured
his daughter Skiolfa. The princess, according to the
custom of those days, became the wife, but practically
the slave, of her captor. She was brought to Sweden,
where Agne and his retainers got beastly drunk on the
occasion of celebrating the memorial rites of her father.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Skiolfa, with the assistance of her Finnish
companions, passed a rope through the massive gold
chain on the neck of the king, and hung him to a
tree, beneath which their tent was pitched. Having
avenged the death of her father, the princess and
her friends embarked in their boats, and escaped to
Finland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They finished him, then,&rdquo; laughed Captain Lincoln.
&ldquo;But what sort of boats had they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; replied Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could they cross the Baltic in boats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. When you go to Finland you will find that
the course will be through islands nearly all the way.
There is no difficulty in crossing in an open boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the population of Stockholm?&rdquo; asked
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundred and thirty-five thousand,&rdquo; replied
M&ouml;ller. &ldquo;It was founded by King Birger in 1250.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a monitor,&rdquo; said Paul, pointing to the
waters near Castelholmen, not far from the anchorage
of the squadron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have four in the Swedish navy, and Russia
has plenty of them. Ericsson, who invented them,
was a Swede, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the tourists had surveyed the panorama to
their satisfaction, they descended, and entering the carriage,
drove over to the Riddarholm, where the guide
pointed out the church, the statue of Gustavus Vasa,
the house of the Nobles, and other objects of interest.
Returning to the quay, they stopped to look at the
little steamers which were whisking about in every
direction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
&ldquo;That is the National Museum,&rdquo; said M&ouml;ller, pointing
to a large and elegant building across the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to sail in one of those little boats,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Kendall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go over and back in ten minutes, if you
like,&rdquo; added the guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party alighted from the carriage, and entered
the little boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did you pay, Paul?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fare is no larger than the boat. It is three
&ouml;re each person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see; eight tenths of a cent, or less than a
halfpenny, English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excursionists returned without landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to go again,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;It is
delightful sailing in such dear little steamers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, we will ride over to the Djurgarden,
and return by the steamer, which will land us at
the Str&ouml;mparterre,&rdquo; said the guide.</p>

<p>This proposition was accepted, and by a circuitous
route they reached the place indicated, which, in
English, is the Deer Garden. It is on an island, separated
from the main land by a channel. The southern
portion of it is a thickly-populated village, but the
principal part of the island is laid out as a park, of
which the people of Stockholm are justly proud. It
was originally a sterile tract of land: the first improvements
converted it into a deer park for the royal
use; but Gustaf III. and Charles (XIV.) John, as Bernadotte
was styled, turned it into a public park. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
laid out in walks and avenues beautifully shaded with
oaks and other trees. The land is undulating, and parts
of it command splendid views of the islands and watercourses
in the vicinity. On the outskirts is an asylum
for the blind and for deaf mutes. Rosendahl, a country
house, built by Charles John in 1830, and often
occupied by him, is quite near the park.</p>

<p>The party drove through the principal avenues of
the garden, and stopped at the bust of Bellman, the
great poet of Sweden, whose birthday is annually celebrated
here with music and festivities. Around the
park are various tea-gardens, caf&eacute;s, and other places
of amusement, including a theatre, circus, and opera-house
for summer use. There is an Alhambra, with
a restaurant; a Tivoli, with a concert-room; a Novilla,
with a winter garden, and a concert hall for summer.
The tourists stopped at Hasselbacken, which is celebrated
for its good dinners at moderate prices. The
visitors seated themselves in a broad veranda, overlooking
a garden filled with little tables, in the centre
of which was a kiosk for the music. The viands, especially
the salmon, were very nice, and the coffee,
as usual, was excellent. After dinner a short walk
brought the party to the landing-place of the little
steamers, where, paying eight &ouml;re, or about two cents,
each, they embarked. The boat flew along at great
speed for such a small craft, whisked under the Skeppsholm
bridge, and in a few moments landed the tourists
at the circular stone quay, which surrounds the
Str&ouml;mparterre. Paul and his lady walked to the hotel,
and the doctor and the captain went to the Skeppsbron,
where a boat soon conveyed them to the ship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Sanford and Stockwell had been on board several
hours, and had had time to make up their minds in regard
to their future course. They had considered the
advice of the boatswain, and finally concluded to adopt
it. Clyde Blacklock was as tame as a parlor poodle.
His experience in running away, especially after his
three days on board of the Rensdyr, was far from
satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must go into that cage again,&rdquo; said
he, when he went on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on yourself,&rdquo; replied Peaks. &ldquo;If
you say that you don&#8217;t intend to run away again, we
shall not put you in the brig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I won&#8217;t,&rdquo; added Clyde.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know I won&#8217;t. I will try to do the best I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all we ask,&rdquo; said Peaks. &ldquo;You can say
all this to the principal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington returned earlier than most of the
ship&#8217;s company, and Peaks reported to him immediately.
The coxswain and his associate were called
up first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come on board, sir,&rdquo; said Sanford, touching
his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have. You have been gone a long time,
and I have been told that you had some difficulty in
finding the ship,&rdquo; added the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have concluded to tell the whole truth, sir,&rdquo;
said Sanford, hanging his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t wish to find the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can you explain the accident by which the second
cutter was stove at Christiansand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it on purpose; but no other fellow was to
blame, or knew anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am astonished to think you should expose the
lives of your crew, by pushing your boat right into
the path of a steamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t do it, sir, till the steamer had stopped her
wheels. I wanted to get on board of her, and leave
the ship. In Norway, I cheated the rest of the party,
and led them out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Ole what to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you wished to travel alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sanford and Stockwell made a clean breast of it,
explaining how they had lost trains and steamers, and
thus avoided returning to the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Ole is a rogue as well as the rest of you, it
seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did what I told him to do, and paid him for
doing,&rdquo; replied Sanford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a runaway, too,&rdquo; interposed the boatswain,
who proceeded to tell the story of the waif. &ldquo;The
boy has suffered a good deal from the ill-treatment of
his step-father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for him; but his character does not
seem to be up to the average of that of his countrymen.
I don&#8217;t think we want him on board,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Lowington. &ldquo;As you say this Olaf has no
claim for his services, we will see about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rensdyr had by this time arrived at the quay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
and it was not believed that Captain Olaf would permit
his step-son, whose services seemed to be of so
much value to him, to escape without making an effort
to reclaim him. After all hands had returned from
the shore, he put in an appearance, and seeing Peaks
in the waist, directed his steps towards him. The
profusion of fine uniforms, the order and discipline that
reigned on deck, and the dignified mien of the instructors
who were walking back and forth, seemed to produce
an impression upon the mind of the rough skipper,
for he took off his hat, and appeared to be as
timid as though he had come into the presence of the
king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Captain Olaf,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the boy Ole,&rdquo; replied the skipper, bowing,
and returning the salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must talk with the principal about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peaks conducted Olaf to the quarter-deck, where
Mr. Lowington was conversing with Mr. and Mrs.
Kendall, who had come on board to visit their old
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the man that claims Ole,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the boy, sir,&rdquo; added Captain Olaf, bowing
as gracefully as he knew how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Ole chooses to go with you, he may go,&rdquo; replied
the principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not choose to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall not compel him to go,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make him go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
&ldquo;I shall allow no violence on board of this ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is my boy; the son of my wife that is
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not your son, and you have no more claim
on him than I have. The boy is an orphan. Have
you been appointed his guardian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question was out of Olaf&#8217;s depth in the English
language; but it was translated into Danish by Professor
Badois, and the skipper did not pretend that he
had any legal authority over the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have fed and clothed him, and he must work
for me,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole says you did not feed him, and he had nothing
but a few dirty rags on when we picked him up. I
have nothing to do with the matter. Ole is free to go
or stay, just as he pleases,&rdquo; replied the principal, turning
away from the skipper, to intimate that he wished
to say nothing more about the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy is here, and I shall make him go with
me,&rdquo; said Olaf, looking ugly enough to do anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington glanced at Peaks, and appeared to
be satisfied that no harm would come to Ole. Olaf
walked back into the waist, and then to the forecastle,
glancing at every student he met, in order to identify
his boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Norway; there comes your guardian
genius,&rdquo; said Scott, who, with a dozen others, had
gathered around the trembling waif, determined to
protect him if their services were needed. &ldquo;Bear a
hand, and tumble down the fore-hatch. Herr Skippenboggin
is after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ole heeded this good advice, and followed by his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
supporters, he descended to the steerage. Olaf saw
him, and was about to descend the ladder, when Peaks
interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&#8217;t go down there,&rdquo; said he, decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the boy,&rdquo; replied Olaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No visitors in the steerage without an invitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have Ole;&rdquo; and the skipper began to descend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast, my hearty,&rdquo; interposed the boatswain, laying
violent hands on Olaf, and dragging him to the
deck.</p>

<p>Bitts, the carpenter, and Leach, the sailmaker,
placed themselves beside the boatswain, as the Norwegian
picked himself up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave the ship, now,&rdquo; said Peaks, pointing
to the accommodation stairs.</p>

<p>Olaf looked at the three stout men before him, and
prudence triumphed over his angry passions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have the boy yet,&rdquo; said he, as he walked
to the stairs, closely attended by the three forward
officers.</p>

<p>He went down into his boat, declaring that he would
seize upon Ole the first time he caught him on shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Clyde?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lowington, as soon
as the savage skipper had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is forward, sir; he behaves like a new man,
and says he will not run away,&rdquo; replied Peaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send him aft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clyde went aft. He was a boy of quick impulses
and violent temper. He had been accustomed to have
his own way; and this had done more to spoil him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
than anything else. He had to learn that there was a
power greater than himself, to which he must submit.
He had twice run away, and failed both times. Three
days of fear and absolute misery on board of the
Rensdyr had given him time to think. He determined,
when he reached Stockholm, to return to his
mother, and try to be a better boy. Peaks, in the little
steamer, had come upon him like a ghost. He had
expected never again to see the ship, or his particular
tormentor; and to have the latter appear to him in
such an extraordinary manner was very impressive, to
say the least. He realized that he must submit; but
this thought, like that of resistance before, was only
an impulse.</p>

<p>Clyde submitted, and was even candid enough to
say so to the principal, who talked to him very gently
and kindly for an hour, pointing out to him the ruin
which he was seeking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try you again, Clyde,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowington.
&ldquo;We will wipe out the past, and begin again.
You may go forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and for a change, the
officers and crews of the several vessels were permitted
to land, and march to the English church in Stockholm.
The neat and pleasant little church was crowded to its
utmost capacity by the attendance of such a large
number. Mr. Agneau, the chaplain, was invited to
take a part in the service, and as Mrs. Kendall, Mrs.
Shuffles, and many of the ship&#8217;s company were good
singers, the vocal music was better than usual.</p>

<p>On Monday morning commenced the serious business
of sight-seeing in Stockholm. The royal palace,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
one of the largest and finest in Europe, and the most
prominent building in the city, was the first place to
be visited. It is four hundred and eighteen feet long,
by three hundred and ninety-one wide, with a large
court-yard in the middle, from which are the principal
entrances. The lower story is of granite; the rest of
brick, covered with stucco. The students walked
through the vast number of apartments it contains;
through red chambers, green chambers, blue chambers,
and yellow chambers, as they are designated,
through the royal chapel, which is as large as a good-sized
church, and through the throne-room, where the
king opens the sessions of the Diet. Several were devoted
to the Swedish orders of knighthood. The
ceilings and walls of the state apartments are beautifully
adorned with allegorical and mythological paintings.</p>

<p>The chamber of Bernadotte, or Charles John, remains
just as it was during his last sickness. On the
bed lies his military cloak, which he wore in his great
campaigns. His cane, the gift of Charles XIII., stands
in the room. The walls are covered with green silk,
and adorned with portraits of the royal family. The
apartments actually occupied by the present king were
found to be far inferior in elegance to many republican
rooms. His chamber has a pine floor, with no carpet;
but it looked more home-like than the great barn-like
state-rooms. In a series of small and rather low apartments
are several collections of curious and antique articles,
such as a collection of arms, including a pair of
pistols presented to the king by President Lincoln;
and of pipes, containing every variety in use, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
smoking-room. The king&#8217;s library looks like business,
for its volumes seemed to be for use rather than ornament.
The billiard-room is quite cosy, and his chamber
contains photographs of various royal personages,
as the Prince of Wales, the Queen of England, and
others, which look as though the king had friends, and
valued them like common people. His majesty paints
very well for a king, and the red cabinet contains pictures
by him, and by Oscar I. The queen&#8217;s apartments,
as well as the king&#8217;s, seemed to the boys like a
mockery of royalty, for they were quite plain and comfortable.
The entire palace contains five hundred and
eighty-three rooms.</p>

<p>The whole forenoon was employed in visiting the
palace, and the students went on board the vessels to
dinner. As the day was pleasant, a boat excursion to
Drottningholm was planned, and the fourteen boats
of the squadron were soon in line. A pilot was in
the commodore&#8217;s barge, to indicate the course. Passing
under the North Bridge, the excursion entered
the waters of the M&auml;ler Lake. A pull of two hours
among beautiful islands, covered with the fresh green of
spring, through narrow and romantic passages, brought
them to their destination. In some places, within five
miles of Stockholm, the scene was so quiet, and nature
so primitive, that the excursionists could have
believed they were hundreds of miles from the homes
of civilization. Two or three of the islands had a
house or two upon them; but generally they seemed
to be unimproved. The boats varied their order at
the command of Commodore Cumberland, and when
there were any spectators, nothing could exceed their
astonishment at the display.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
At Drottningholm, or Queen&#8217;s Island, there is a
fine palace, built by the widow of Charles X., and afterwards
improved and embellished by the kings of
Sweden. Attached to it is a beautiful garden, adorned
with fountains and statues. The party went through
the palace, which contains a great many historical
paintings, and some rooms fitted up in Chinese style.
As the students were about to embark, a char-a-banc,
a kind of open omnibus, drawn by four horses, drove
up to the palace, and a plainly-dressed lady alighted.
She stood on the portico, looking at the students; and
the pilot said she was the Queen Dowager, wife of
Oscar I. Of course the boys looked at her with quite as
much interest as she regarded them. The commodore
called for three cheers for the royal lady, who was the
daughter of Eugene Beauharnais, and granddaughter
of the Empress Josephine. She waved her handkerchief
in return for the salute, and the students
were soon pulling down the lake towards Stockholm.</p>

<p>The next forenoon was devoted to the Royal Museum,
which has been recently erected. It contains a
vast quantity of Swedish antiquities and curiosities,
with illustrations of national manners and customs.
It contains specimens of the various implements used
in the ages of wood, stone, bronze, and iron, collections
of coins and medals, armor, engravings, sculptures,
and paintings, including a few works of the
great masters of every school in Europe. The students
were particularly interested in what Scott irreverently
called the &ldquo;Old Clothes Room,&rdquo; in which were deposited
in glass cases the garments and other articles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
belonging to the Swedish kings and queens, such as
the cradle and toys of Charles XII., and the huge
sword with which he defended himself against the
Turks at Bender; the sword of Gustavus Vasa; the
costume of Gustaf III., which he wore when he was
shot in the opera-house by Ankarstr&ouml;m; the baton of
Gustaf Adolf, and the watch of Queen Christina.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the students made an excursion by
steamer to Ulriksdal, the summer residence of Bernadotte,
Oscar I., and of the present king. It is a
beautiful place, and is filled with objects of historical
interest. The furniture is neat, pretty, and comfortable.
The chamber of the king is the plainest of all,
but the bed was used by Gustaf II. in Germany.
Every chair, table, and mirror has its history. There
is a collection of beer mugs in one chamber, and of
pipes in another. The place is full of interest to the
curious. In the water in front of the palace were several
gilded pleasure-boats, and a fanciful steamer for
the use of the royal family.</p>

<p>The steamer in which the party had gone to Ulriksdal
was one of the larger class, though the company
was all she could carry. She made her way through
the several arms of the sea, between the islands, passing
through two drawbridges. For the return trip
four of the smaller steamers had been engaged, each
of which would carry about fifty boys. A short distance
from the palace, the boats turned into a narrow
stream, passing under bridges, in places so contracted
that the engine had to be stopped, and the banks were
thoroughly washed. Then they entered a lagoon, bordered
with villas, and surrounded by pleasant scenery.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Landing at a point in the northern suburb, most of
the students walked through the city to the quay,
though several omnibuses ply between this point and
the centre of the city.</p>

<p>The next day opened with a visit to Riddarholm.
The church, or Riddarholmskyrkan, on this island, was
formerly a convent, but is now the mausoleum of the
most celebrated kings of Sweden. It was once a
Gothic structure; but the addition of several chapels
on the sides, for monuments, has completely changed
the appearance of the structure. It is remarkable for
nothing except the tombs within it. Formerly it contained
a number of equestrian figures, clothed in armor,
which was valued as relics of the ancient time,
including that of Birger Jarl, the founder of the city,
and of Charles IX.; but all these have been removed
to the National Museum, which is certainly a more
appropriate place for them. On each side of the
church are the sepulchral chapels of Gustavus Adolphus,
Charles XII., Bernadotte, and Oscar I. The
Queen D&eacute;sir&eacute;e, wife of Bernadotte, and sister-in-law
of Joseph Bonaparte, with others of the royal family,
and some of the great captains of the Thirty Years&#8217;
War, are buried here. In the chapels of Gustavus
and Charles XII. are placed many of the trophies
of their victories, such as flags, drums, swords, and
keys.</p>

<p>The party then visited the Riddarhus, where the
nobles meet, which is the scene of several great historical
events, and contains the shields of three thousand
Swedish nobles. From this point the tourists
went to Mosebacke, a celebrated tea garden, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
high land in the southern suburb, where they ascended
to the roof of the theatre in order to obtain a view of
the city and its surroundings.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the students made an excursion to
Upsala, the ancient capital of Sweden, which contains
a fine old cathedral, where Gustavus Vasa and
two of his wives are buried. His tomb was hardly
more interesting to the Americans than that of Linn&aelig;us,
the great botanist, who was born in Upsala,
and buried in this church. Other Swedish kings
are also buried here. The party visited the university,
which contains some curious old books and
manuscripts, such as an old Icelandic Edda; the Bible,
with written notes by Luther and Melanchthon;
the Journal of Linn&aelig;us, and the first book ever printed
in Sweden, in 1483. The house of the great botanist
and the botanical garden were not neglected.
The tourists returned to Stockholm in a special
steamer, through an arm of Lake M&auml;ler, and landed
at the Riddarholm. On Friday some of the students
went to the Navy Yard, and on board of a
monitor, while others wandered about the city and its
suburbs.</p>

<p>After spending a week in the harbor, the voyagers
felt that they had seen enough of Sweden; and early
on Saturday morning, with a pilot on board of each
vessel, the squadron sailed for the Aland Islands, in
the Baltic, where the principal decided to pass a
week. The vessels lay in the channels between the
islands, and the students attended to the regular routine
of study and seamanship. Occasional excursions
were made on shore, mostly at the uninhabited islands.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Journals of what had been seen in Norway, Denmark,
and Sweden were written up; but the students were
very anxious to visit Russia.</p>

<p>Ole Amundsen was very careful to avoid his step-father
while he remained in Stockholm. He hardly
went on shore, so great was his dread of the cruel
skipper of the Rensdyr; and no one rejoiced more
heartily than he to leave the Swedish waters. Mr.
Lowington did not desire to retain him on board; but
the waif begged so hard to remain, and the students
liked him so well, that he was finally engaged as an
assistant steward in the steerage, at twelve dollars a
month; but he made double this sum, besides, out of
the boys, by the exercise of his genius in mending
clothes, cleaning shoes, and similar services, which
the students preferred to pay for, rather than do themselves.</p>

<p>Clyde Blacklock kept his promise as well as he
could, and soon learned his duty as a seaman. Though
he certainly improved, his violent temper and imperious
manners kept him continually in hot water. He
could not forget his old grudge against Burchmore,
and during an excursion on one of the Aland Islands,
he attacked him, but was soundly thrashed for his
trouble, and punished on board when his black eye
betrayed him. While he is improving there is hope
for him.</p>

<p>The runaways promised so much and behaved so
well, that none of them were punished as yet, though
Sanford was deprived of his position as coxswain of
the second cutter; but whether they were to be allowed
any liberty in Russia, they were not informed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
At the close of the week among the islands, the
squadron was headed for Abo, in Finland, which is
now a province of Russia; and what they saw and
did there, and in other parts of the vast empire, will
be related in <span class="smcap">Northern Lands, or Young America
in Russia and Prussia</span>.</p>
